
I'm painting my smile, drying my tears
Cover it all (cover it all)
You wear a disguise, hiding your fears
Put up a wall

But underneath it all that love we had is gone
We already let go
But we put on a show, so nobody knows
'Cause we ain't ready to fall

It's a masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a masquerade!
Dancing around the truth
But I don't wanna lie
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's OK
It hurts too much to face
It's over, so we keep living in a masquerade!

You're all that I know, so comfortable
But the feeling is gone
And even though we need more
We're scared of being alone, so the show goes on

If we took off our mask then we could never last
'Cause we'll be forced to see
It's all to make believe
'Cause we're not who we used to be

It's a masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a masquerade!
Dancing around the truth
But I don't wanna lie
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's OK
It hurts too much to face
It's over, so we keep living in a masquerade!

I'm wiping my smile off
Letting the tears come streaming down
You take your disguise off
Bringing your walls down to the ground
We be screaming inside
We can finally let it go
The truth is out now
We're face to face
Time to put it into this

It's a masquerade!
We've been trying to hide our faces behind a masquerade!
Dancing around the truth
But I don't wanna lie
I'm tired of pretending
Acting like everything's OK
It hurts to much to face
It's over, so we keep living in a masquerade!
