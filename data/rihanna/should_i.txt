
Boy, your standing real close to me
Tell me now, what's it gonna be?
You like what you see but loving don't come easily
Now your whispering in my ear, all the things that I wanna hear
Let me make it very clear, words are not enough for me
Did you think that you could smile and steal my heart away?
Can't deny I like your style, but it just don't work that way

Ooh, I'm kinda feeling you right now
You keep me standing tight now
It's getting hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?
Ooh, you know they're playing my song now
You know you're turning me on now
The feelings getting strong now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?

Back and forth, baby, round and round
So high that I can't come down
It's too late to turn back now
Still, I'm scared to lose control
Feel the heat burning like the sun
Feel the beat as we move as one
Don't stop 'til the night is done
Hold me close, boy, don't let go
Still, I got to know if this is real or just a dream
Because in the morning, my true love is what I wanna see

Ooh, I'm kinda feeling you right now (Feeling you baby)
You keep me standing tight now
It's getting hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? (Still, I wonder, wonder should I?)
Ooh, you know they're playing my song now
You know you're turning me on now (Ooh, baby)
The feelings getting strong now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? Yeah

I'ma need ya body so mi can't wait no longer
Haffi get ya body, gyal, you mi haffi conquer
So put it up 'cause mi nah guh pet it up
A girl like you does make a man feel like he inna love (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dis is not a fantasy, dis is not a dream
Three drink a Guinness and mi deh pon the scene
Gyal, bruk out and wine to the beat
Let me stop put it pon her 'cause she a get it real deep

Did you think you could smile and steal my heart away?
Can't deny I like your style, but it just don't work that way

Ooh, I'm kinda feeling you right now (Feeling you right now)
You keep me standing tight now
It's getting hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I? (Still, I wonder, wonder should I?)
Ooh, you know they're playing my song now
You know you're turning me on now (Ooh, baby)
The feelings getting strong now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?
Ooh, I'm kinda feeling you right now (Can't control what I'm feeling baby)
You keep me standing tight now
It's getting hard to fight now
Still, I wonder, wonder should I?
Ooh, you know they're playing my song now
