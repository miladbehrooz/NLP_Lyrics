
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
How do I take it off if I love at all?
It's like a work of art
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap)

How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken-hearted soul
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
(Bass slap, bass slap)

It may be wrong, but it feels right
All my fears are gone tonight
I'm lost in paradise

I'm so lost in paradise (Lost in paradise)
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
Lost in paradise
Yeah
Lost in paradise
Lost in paradise
(Bass slap)
