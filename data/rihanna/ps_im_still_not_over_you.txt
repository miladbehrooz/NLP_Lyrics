
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No, mm

What's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinking 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother? How's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line to the story of me and you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothing to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you)
You, yeah, mm

Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I woulda put it all behind me
But it seems there's always something right there to remind me
Like a silly joke or something on the TV
Boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song, I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you, you

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothing to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, you, you
(Still not over you) You, yeah, mm-mm

Did you know I kept all of your pictures?
Don't have the strength to part with them yet, oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things, a girl can never forget

Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothing to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you, oh
(Still not over you)
Oh, I tried to forget you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better (Don't get no better)
As each day goes by (As each day goes by)
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothing to lose
