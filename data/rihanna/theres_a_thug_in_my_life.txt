
Gotta keep it on the down low
I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lot of game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything

I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (So good to me)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him everything)

T-H-U-G in ya life, baby
One in a million, that's what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got the tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving
And loving, that's all I'm giving

Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me (He's all I ever need)
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be

There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama? (How am I gonna tell my mama?)
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me (Yeah)
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything (Give him all of me)

Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry (All of me)
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
