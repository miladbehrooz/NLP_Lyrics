Yeah, ay, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Baby boy, what you done to me?
I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got it bad boy, I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna talk to you and not to mention
Good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No, I won't apologize for feeling like I do (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day, I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
Boy, it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize

They might say I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you (I'm a selfish girl)
Every minute of the day, I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
(What you're giving me boy)
Boy it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
(When it comes to love, I don't share)
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl

Boy, you got me tripping
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I don't mean to be demanding
But I hope you're understanding
I'm not playing, boy (I'm not playing, boy)
I'm just saying, boy

They might say I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way

(I'm a selfish girl) I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day (Every day), I'm addicted to
What you're giving me
Boy it's killing me
And when it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
(Need you in my world, I'm a selfish girl)

Boy, you got me tripping
(Boy, you got me tripping)
I didn't know what I was missing (Know what I was missing)
This is crazy (Crazy)
So amazing (So amazing)
I didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope your understanding
