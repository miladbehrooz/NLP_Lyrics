
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's got the most inflated ego of them all?
Thinks he can do a booty call
That thinks he is so lovable
That thinks he is the perfect man
That I shouldn't of ever let go
And that's why I let him go
The first thing he wants in the morning ain't you
It's all about him in the morning, baby
You got a boy like I had, using you
A boy like that is using baby
Let me help you understand the sexy grin from ear to ear
Girl, if you were inside his head
This is what you'd hear

Ayo, you gotta love me (Love me)
Bitch, I'm special (Bitch, I'm special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something-something they don't have (Uh huh)
You gotta love me (Love me)
Bitch, I'm special (Bitch, I'm special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something-something they don't have

La da da da da da

He handled me like merchandise
Hate to admit the down payment was his bedroom eyes (Yeah)
Ay, then after he passed home base, he started to pump the breaks
My heavenly bliss destroyed
He flipped a U-ey in my face
I was the grand prize that he hardly had to chase
Said goodbye 'cause I coulda sworn I heard him say

You gotta love me (Love me)
Bitch, I'm special (Bitch, I'm special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something-something they don't have
You gotta love me (Love me)
Bitch, I'm special (Bitch, I'm special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something-something they don't have
You gotta love me (Love me)
Bitch, I'm special (Bitch, I'm special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something-something they don't have
You gotta love me (Love me)
Bitch, I'm special (Bitch, I'm special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something-something they don't have

La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da

You don't gotta love no selfish man
Let him love on himself (Yeah)
Let him love on himself (Yeah)
Let him love on himself (Yeah)
Let him love someone else (Yeah)
Let him love someone else
I'm just too good, too good
'Cause he said

You gotta love me (Love me)
Bitch, I'm special (Bitch, I'm special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something-something they don't have (Uh huh)
You gotta love me (Love me)
Bitch, I'm special (Bitch, I'm special)
I want everybody thinking that I got something-something they don't have

Bitch!
