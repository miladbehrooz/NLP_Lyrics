
So give it to me like I want it
This is for your eyes only
Rock me out back and forth
Rock me out on the floor

Give it to me like I need it
You know how to make me feel it
Rock me out more and more
Rock me out on the floor, yeah

Come over, boy, I'm so ready
You're taking too long to get my head on the ground
And my feet in the clouds, oh-oh
I'm so clean, feeling so dirty
Come right now, you better hurry
Before you miss out, and I finish it off
Oh, yeah

I've been a bad girl, daddy
Won't you come get me?

So give it to me like I want it
This is for your eyes only
Rock me out back and forth
Rock me out on the floor

Give it to me like I need it
You know how to make me feel it
Rock me out more and more
Rock me out on the floor, yeah

Keep it up for me, you can do it
Put your hands on me, watch me lose it
Boy, blew it out, like it's the only way out
I'll show you my dirty secrets
We'll hush up boy, don't just speak it
Whatever we do, it's between me and you

I've been a bad girl, daddy
Won't you come get me?

So give it to me like I want it
This is for your eyes only
Rock me out back and forth
Rock me out on the floor

Give it to me like I need it
You know how to make me feel it
Rock me out more and more
Rock me out on the floor, yeah

It's gonna be different tonight
The best time in your life
I just want you to know, baby
Take a peek at the girl I hide
I'll let you in on a dirty secret
I just wanna be loved

So give it to me like I want it
This is for your eyes only
Rock me out back and forth
Rock me out on the floor

Give it to me like I need it
You know how to make me feel it
Rock me out more and more
Rock me out on the floor
