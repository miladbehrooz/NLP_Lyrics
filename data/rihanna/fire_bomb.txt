
Gunfire left a hole in the tank
Losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail
And he's after me

Hope it don't get here
Before I get where I'm going
I gotta get where I'm going
Take off my mask to breathe

You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing

Where I'm going I don't need my brakes brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So, I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Seems cold but, baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through
It's the other half of me

I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing

Where we're going we don't need no brakes brakes
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb

Baby, we were killing them
They couldn't handle the millionth degree
We were criminals
As we were burning
The world called the police
Fire department, ambulance
You can call me crazy
'Cause I believe the only move for me and you
Is to go out blazing

The lovers need to clear the road
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh, oh

I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm coming from
Fire bomb
Oh, oh, oh
Fire bomb
