Bitch better have my money
Y'all should know me well enough
Bitch better have my money
Please don't call me on my bluff
Pay me what you owe me
Balling bigger than LeBron
Bitch, give me your money
Who y'all think y'all fronting on?
Like bra, bra, bra

Louis XIII, and it's all on me, nigga, you just bought a shot
Kamikaze, if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shots, shots, shots
Like bra, bra, bra
Pay me what you owe, don't act like you forgot

Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my (Bitch better have my)
Bitch better have my (Bitch better have my)
Bitch better have my money

Turn up to Rihanna while the whole club fucking wasted
Every time I drop by, I am the only thing y'all playing
In a drop top, doing hundred, y'all in my rear-view mirror racing
Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?
Like bra, bra, bra

Louis XIII, and it's all on me, nigga, you just bought a shot
Kamikaze, if you think that you gon' knock me off the top
Shit, your wife in the backseat of my brand new foreign car
Don't act like you forgot
I call the shots, shots, shots
Like bra, bra, bra
Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot

Bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money
Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my (Bitch better have my)

Pay me what you owe me
Bitch better have my (Bitch better have my)

Bitch, bitch, bitch better have my money
Yo, that bitch better have my money

Yo, my money
That bitch better have my money
