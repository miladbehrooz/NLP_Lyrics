Uh huh, uh huh (yeah, Rihanna)
(Chris Brown)
Uh huh, uh huh (good girl gone bad)
Uh huh, uh huh (take three, action)
Uh huh, uh huh (Hov)

No clouds in my stones, let it rain
I hydroplane in the bank coming down with the Dow Jones (ay, ay, ay, ay)
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella (ay, ay, ay, ay)
We fly higher than weather, in G5s or better
You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back (ay, ay, ay, ay)
With little Ms. Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at? (ay, ay, ay, ay)

You have my heart and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there, with you I'll always share because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

You're becoming a dream to me, a fairy tale fantasy
Nothing can never compare an image to my memory
Girl, I'm asking, could you be my queen? A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there, it's something we both share because

When the sun shine, we'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever
Although it's a lot of rain outside
Girl, it's getting late, and you can stay the night
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car, I ain't tryna stress you
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl, you can be my Cinderellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay
You can be my Cinderellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay
You can be my Cinderellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay
You can be my Cinderellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

You can run into my arms
It's OK don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and say my name some more
I'll be all you need and more (ah, you ready?)
Because

When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath, I'm 'a stick it out 'til the end
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress you
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl, you can be my Cinderellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay
You can be my Cinderellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay
Under my umbrella ellaâellaâella, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

It's raining (raining)
Ooh baby, it's raining (raining)
Baby, come into me (oh)
Come into me
It's raining (Rihanna)
Oh baby, it's raining (Rihanna)
You can always come into me
Come into me
