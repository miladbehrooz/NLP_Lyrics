(What's wrong with me?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(Why do I feel like this?)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
(I'm going crazy now)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

No more gas in the rig (Can't even get it started)
Nothing heard, nothing said (Can't even speak about it)
All my life on my head (Don't wanna think about it)
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (Aha!)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (Aha!)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (Aha!)
It's too close for comfort, ah

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Your mind's in disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum

Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talking to me
Disconnected, no one calls
The phone don't even ring
I gotta get out, or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort, oh

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (Aha!)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (Aha!)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (Aha!)
I feel like a monster, oh

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder (City lights)
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice (Think twice)
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise (Be wise)

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like (What you like)
Disturbia, disturbia

Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Disturbia)
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum (Oh-oh)

Release me from this curse I'm in
Trying to maintain, but I'm struggling
If you can't go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think I'm gonna ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Put on your brake lights
You're in the city of wonder
Ain't gon' play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
(Better think twice) Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise
(So if you must falter, be wise)

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
Disturbia, ain't used to what you like
Disturbia, disturbia

Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
Bum bum be-dum, bum bum be-dum bum
