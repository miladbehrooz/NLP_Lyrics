
I just met infatuation
It's something in his smile
Now my obsession can't stand the thoughts of you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it, I got you pushing up on me

On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doing it like I'm at work
I'm making that thing jerk
I'm making that thing twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doing what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ah

Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doing it like I'm at work
I'm making that thing jerk
I'm making that thing twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doing what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ah

We're flashing pictures
Kodak moment memories
Look at the flickers
Sparks on my camera screen
The buried treasure
Come with me and we will find
Create a perfect world, just for you and I

On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me

Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doing it like I'm at work
I'm making that thing jerk
I'm making that thing twerk (So get up on it, baby)
I'm doing what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ah

Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

All them girls in the club, get down tonight
All them girls grab a boy, keep doing it right
All them girls in the club, get down tonight
All them girls grab a boy, keep doing it right
