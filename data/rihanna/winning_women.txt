Gonna win it no limits, strong women we are
Gotta win it no limits, strong women we are

Where them girls at
Girls, that like to be in charge
When the heat get too hot, they just keep turning it up
Never let 'em cheat-sheet, they just sweat, gotta go hard
Where those winning women that's really willing to take it off!

Uh-uh-uh-uh huh
When you see both of us on the catwalk representing our culture
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh
Well the time and day has changed
Where there's women wearing pants
Without changing their last names
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh
Where the word diva, diva, mean viva, viva, we run Las Vegas
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh
And then the stock exchange
Bang, then we got claim to the change

All, all, all a girl want, wants
All a girl need, needs
Is just all those simple things, like to be cared for
Just to have him be there for ya
All that matters, is those sweet things
That's all a girl really wants

Uh-uh-uh-uh huh
We are too confident, me and him talked to Phil
Never happened again
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh
We don't wait, we get paid, for our trait holidays
We sip lemonade
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh
Instead of doing what he wants, we do what we want
Buying homes in Geneva
Uh-uh-uh-uh huh
Like when the sound baby glance, rings, and that means more than things

All, all, all a girl want, wants
All a girl need, needs
Is just all those simple things, like to be cared for
Just to have him be there for ya
All that matters, is those sweet things
