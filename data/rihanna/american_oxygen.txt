American oxygen, whoa
Every breath I breathe
Chasing this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, whoa
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

American oxygen
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

Oh say, can you see â this is the American Dream
Young girl, hustling on the other side of the ocean
You can be anything at all in America, America (America, America)
I say if you can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, whoa
Every breath I breathe
Chasing this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, whoa
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

Oh say, can you see â this is the American Dream
Young boy, hustling, tryna get the wheels in motion
But he can be anything at all in America, America
(America, America)
I say if you can't see
Just close your eyes and breathe

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, whoa
Every breath I breathe
Chasing this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, whoa
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America

Breathe out, breathe in
American oxygen, whoa
Every breath I breathe
Chasing this American Dream
We sweat for a nickel and a dime
Turn it into an empire, whoa
Breathe in this feeling
American, American oxygen

American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen
American oxygen
Breathe in, this feeling
American, American oxygen

This is the new America
We are the new America
This is the new America
We are the new America
