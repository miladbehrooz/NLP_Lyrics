
In a perfect world
We would make love over war
With our hands in the air
And no problems and no cares, oh no, oh no
Oh America, all the way down to Africa
We keep singing as the world spins
Round and round and round and round
And round and round and round
And round and round and round

And we'll dance in the rain despite of all the pain
What the world really needs to feel love again
What the world really needs to feel love again
Round and round and round

In a perfect world
There would be no lonely ones
We would keep our hands in the air
With no problems no cares oh no, oh no
From London to Japan
Everyone woman, boy, girl, and man
Come on, come dance with me

And we'll dance in the rain despite of all the pain
What the world really needs to feel love again
What the world really needs to feel love again
Round and round and round

Maximum bass!

And we'll dance in the rain despite of all the pain
What the world really needs to feel love again
What the world really needs to feel love again
Round and round and round
