
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah

When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be when I look into your eyes?
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter, more like butter
Since I met you, boy, my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this

Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to a crazy little thing called love (Crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
Whoa, yeah

My best friends tell me "Rihanna, what's got into you?"
I said "LeAndra, I can't explain these feelings I'm going through"
They tell me "Girl, it's not like you to fall this way"
I try my best to wear a disguise, but it's written on my face

Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one (Maybe you're the one)
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to a crazy little thing called love
(Crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
(A crazy, crazy little thing called love)
Whoa, yeah
(Yeah)

Girl, it's not crazy, it's amazing
It's the loving that you feeling
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing
Hey Rihanna, baby girl, for you mi sing the song, yeah
So tell the DJ put it pon de replay if you wanna
Come on my Bajun baby let me take you to Jamaica
And introduce you to the real type of loving where you ought to
Baby you're my number one, not number two
So if its loving that you want, baby, you should make me your boo

Boy, you got me catching feelings (Boy, you got me)
Got me thinking maybe you're the one (Thinking you're the one)
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum (Beating like a drum)
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to a crazy little thing called love (Crazy, crazy, baby, baby)
(Crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
Whoa, yeah
(Whoa)

Don't understand the meaning
This means crazy, baby
I try my best not to show
But you know it's so crazy, baby
Crazy little thing called love
(Crazy little thing called love)
A crazy little thing called love
Whoa, yeah
