
I'm not concerned with people
Who prey on the wealth of their fellow man (Oh yeah)
'Cause they only wanna know you and roll you
Only for the things you have
I just think it's so sad

Get them haters out your circle (Haters)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (Bring you down, no, no)
Down (Down, yeah)
See them try them best to hurt you, they work you (Oh, they're gonna try)
Anything to bring you down
Down (Down)

They keep evil thoughts in their hearts (What you don't know)
You can't let them knock your hustle
After them not how much you struggle
They turn green with envy when you're on top
And them heart is full with strife
Them all gon' try fi take your life (them haters)

Get them haters out your circle (Know they're gonna smile in your face)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (Bring you down)
Down
See them try them best to hurt you and work you (They try them best, try them best)
Anything to bring you down (To bring you down)
Down (Down)
Get them haters out your circle (Ooh)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (All they wanna do is bring you down)
Down (Down, down, down)
See them try them best to hurt you, they work you (You know they try)
Anything to bring you down (Anything to bring you down)
Down (Down)

You know they talk about you when they tell the lies
So don't be fooled, you better recognize
They're not there for you, they don't care for you
Trust me 'cause I know it's true
You know they smile in your face and make you think they're down
But then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity

Get them haters out your circle (Believe me when I tell you)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (No, no)
Down (Down)
See them try them best to hurt you, they work you
Anything to bring you down (You know they wanna work you, bringing you down, down)
Down
Get them haters out your circle (Ooh)
Smile in your face, but all they wanna do is bring you down (All they wanna do is bring you down)
Down (I don't wanna bring you to the ground)
See them try them best to hurt you, they work you (You know they try)
Anything to bring you down
Down (Down)

You know they talk about you when they tell the lies
So don't be fooled, you better recognize
They're not there for you, they don't care for you
Trust me 'cause I know it's true
You know they smile in your face and make you think they're down
But then they turn against you when you're not around
It's just jealousy and dishonesty
So hold on to your sanity
