
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

It's like spending time with you
Just doing absolutely nothing
That makes me happy
When you're at work, putting on your T-shirt
And I love it, absolutely love it

It's the smile of a child
It's your eyes, it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin
That's what gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
That's nice

Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

It's like walking through the sprinklers
Smelling every flower one by one
Mm, yeah, makes me happy, yeah
It's like telling me you love me
Showing me you love me, baby, my pretty baby

It's the smile of a child
It's your eyes, it's your hair
It's the touch of your skin
That's what gets me there
It's also enticing
Waking up from a nice dream
To a beautiful morning with you by my side
That's nice

Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy

It's like Saturday, oh
Four day weekend, oh
Hiding and seeking with you
Like we do, it's beautiful
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
Just as long as it makes you happy
If it makes you happy, just be happy
