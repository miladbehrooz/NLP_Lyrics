Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you

I've been watching you from way 'cross the room
Won't ya come and rock it out with me?
You catching eyes like you catching ties
Over here's where you wanna be
It's so familiar, like we've met somewhere before
And I'm tired of waiting, baby, while you still obey me

Want me, come and whisper in your ear
All the things you love to hear
I wanna come play nice with you
'Cause if I get you alone, I don't know what I might do
And I think that it's about time we leave
'Cause boy, you're my type
You got me so excited
Baby, let's go dance away

So let me come and get ya right
Boy, let me fill your appetite
Won't you let me know what it is you like?
And I'll do those sexy things for you
I'll let you call me beautiful
Let me give it to you once, you gon' want some more
Boy, let me, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you

I'm walking over to you, meet me by the door
I'm the girl in the seven inch heels
I got my keys in my hand
Maybe S's on my arms, so guess you know what it is
So act like you know
'Cause a girl just wanna have fun
Knock it out the park for me
Need ya to hit a home run, boy

Want me, come and whisper in your ear
All the things you love to hear
I wanna come play nice with you
'Cause if I get you alone, I don't know what I might do
And I think that it's about time we leave
'Cause boy, you're my type
You got me so excited
Baby, let's go dance away

So let me come and get ya right
Boy, let me fill your appetite
Won't you let me know what it is you like?
And I'll do those sexy things for you
I'll let you call me beautiful
Let me give it to you once, you gon' want some more
Boy, let me, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you

Let too much to talk about it
Not into me, boy, I doubt it
You are gonna scream and shout it
Make you hot how I move my body
So crazy, so amazing
Catch you up and make you chase it
Let me, let me, baby
Let me do those things for you

So let me come and get ya right
Boy, let me fill your appetite
Won't you let me know what it is you like?
And I'll do those sexy things for you
I'll let you call me beautiful
Let me give it to you once, you gon' want some more
Boy, let me, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy, let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
Boy, let me, let me
Why don't you let me, let me?
Boy let me, let me
Let me do those things for you
