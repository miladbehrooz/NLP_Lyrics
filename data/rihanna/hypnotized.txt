Teasing me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
Gotta have ya for all the things that you do
It something 'bout this feeling, it's crazy
Amazing that stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized

I'm feeling something that I can't understand
It's like I'm captured by the touch of your hand
It's so vibe, it's your style, it's the way hat you smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name
It's all magnetic with your hand next to me
Holding me close happens so naturally
We connect, this electrical feeling inside
Didn't know that even if I tried

Something 'bout the way that you working me
Teasing me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
Gotta have ya for all the things that you do
It something 'bout this feeling, it's crazy
Amazing that stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized

You got me spinning like a merry go round
Feels like I'm flying, but I ain't off the ground
Falling fast, I'm afraid, can't escape, there's no way
Never had a feeling like this before

Something 'bout the way that you working me
Teasing me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
Gotta have ya for all the things that you do
It something 'bout this feeling, it's crazy
Amazing that stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized

It's amazing how you drive me crazy
Boy keep doing what you're doing
Cause you're really getting through to me
Day and night babe, you know I can't fight it
Just one look into my eyes and you know you got me hypnotized

Something 'bout the way that you working me
Teasing me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
Gotta have ya for all the things that you do
