Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-ooh
Hey, yeah, yeah

Some girls play the game
They all walk and talk and they dress the same
Nothing new to say (Nothing new to say)
Don't they realize
It's so easy to see right through their disguise?
Makes me wonder why

When the whole world's turning left
Is when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside

'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you?
Can give me anything if I asked him to?
Would take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons you ought to be, with a girl like me (Girl like me)
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh (Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Just like me (Just like me)

The possibility
Got me tripping, thinking of what could be
Between you and me (You and me)
Still, I need to know
Should I keep this feeling or let it go?
I can't wait no more
So now's the time to speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you wanna take a chance on something real

'Cause a girl like me (Girl like me), just a little different from all the rest (Whoa-oh, oh-oh)
And a girl like me
Never gonna settle for second best (Never gonna settle)
Could it be a boy like you?
Can give me anything if I asked him to? (If I asked him to?)
To take all my dreams and then make them true
Show me all the reasons you ought to be, with a girl like me
Like me
Oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh (Oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Just like me (Just like me)

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Catch me now before I fall
Wish I may or wish I might
Find the answer here tonight
Mirror, mirror, on the wall (Yeah, yeah)
Catch me now before I fall (Before I fall)
Wish I may or wish I might
Find the answer here tonight

'Cause when the whole world's turning left
