The galdem rush to feel the ill touch
Galdem ball and gyal them a scream
They think ita love, but a lust
That's why a bad gyal beside is a must for I bust
She's the angel of me conscious
Yo, yo, yo

Never thought that I could feel something so strong
I wanna hold onto this moment before it's gone
I wanna hold your body close, it's calling to me
And when I look into your eyes, I'm liking what I see
Boy, don't hold back from me
Just give me everything you got
I wonder I can keep

I catch a rush, boy
Whenever we touch, I go crazy

Whenever we kiss, I can't take it
You know I can't fake it

Yo yo yo
Well, I'm back with the boys and I knowing that
Don't watch my face my gyal, you know I'm coming back
Most of mea gyal them slide off easy like a thunderclap
When I see you from the back, you know me need all a dat
Yo, yo, yo

Don't even know your name
But this feels so right
It's like I've known you boy for all of my life
Don't need to say a word

And my eyes are telling you

You know you got me where you want
Too late I can't slow down
No way we're ever gonna stop
