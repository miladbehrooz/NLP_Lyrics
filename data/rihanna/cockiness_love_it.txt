
Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around

I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire
Fair maiden Rihannagate
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (You)

I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it

Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around

I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
If you want my golden flower
Make me your priority
Place nothing above my pleasure
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (You)

I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it

Hold it down, beat it like a bully
Beat my drum, drum, like a drum line boogie (I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body, hold me tight Mr. Lover (I love it when you)
Do it like I do it, like I said
Keep it up, boy, we can do this all day
Be my Harlem and me St. Tropez
Never found nobody that will do it this way

No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want (You)

I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
