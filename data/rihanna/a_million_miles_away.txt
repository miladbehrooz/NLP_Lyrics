
Here we lay, face to face once again
The silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding onto could have been's, that we should be letting go

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, yeah

Was it me? Or was it you that broke away?
From what we were
'Cause like the seasons, love is change
And every time I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion
But I got no more tears to cry

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
We both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away, hey, hey, hey, yeah

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, ooh-yeah
We can try to talk it over
But we've walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door

It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
And I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
Feels like you're a million miles away
Hey, yeah
A million miles away
