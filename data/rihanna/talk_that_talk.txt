Uh, I be tryna chill, bitches wanna fuck me
Every little city I go, "Fuck me!"
Shorty must've heard, got the word, I move that D
Had it by her bladder, she like, "Oh, I gotta pee!" Ha ha ha
Ran into a Rothko in my restroom
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
Gotta have a ticket for a walk through
Everything I do is big ("Who y'all talking to?")
I talk big money, I talk big homes
I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I'm flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer
Sex on the beach, left love speechless
They say that money talk, tell these other niggas speak up
