
The mood is set (Huh, huh)
So you already know what's next (Uh-huh, ah)
TV on blast, turn it down, turn it down
Don't want it to clash
With my body screaming out, no (No-oh)
I know you hearing it (Oh-oh)
You got me moaning now
I got a secret that I wanna show you, oh
I got a secret, so I'ma drop em to the floor, oh

And no teasing, you waited long enough
Go deep, I'ma throw it at you, can you catch it?
Don't hold back, you know I like it rough
Know I'm feeling you, huh
Know you're liking it, huh
So why you standing over there with your clothes on?
Baby, strip down for me, go on, take 'em off
Don't worry, baby, I'ma meet you halfway
'Cause I know you wanna see me

Almost there (Huh, huh)
So, baby, don't stop what you're doing (Uh-huh, ah)
Softer than a mother, boy, I know you wanna touch
Breathing down my neck, I can tell you wanna (No-oh)
And now you want it like (Oh-oh)
Want you to feel it now
I got a secret that I wanna show you, oh
I got a secret, so I'ma drop em to the floor, oh

And no teasing, you waited long enough
Go deep, I'ma throw it at you, can you catch it?
Don't hold back, you know I like it rough
Know I'm feeling you, huh
Know you're liking it, huh
So why you standing over there with your clothes on?
Baby, strip down for me, go on, take 'em off
Don't worry, baby, I'ma meet you halfway
'Cause I know you wanna see me

No heels, no shirt, no skirt, all I'm in is just skin
No jeans, take 'em off, wanna feel your skin

Wanna take control, ain't nothing wrong with that (Oh whoa)

No heels, no shirt, no skirt, all I'm in is just skin
