I'll say now don't complain
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away
You're so afraid to cry
But your heart be feeling dry
It's time to change
But you keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering why you keep thundering
Won't you just rain?
And get it over with

When I feel the pain
Now, babe, I won't complain
I hear you say, "Look up, the sun is just a cloud away."
And now we're so afraid to cry
When you need a wave to ride, that's the way
You keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering why you keep thundering
Won't you just fucking rain?
And get it over with

I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again
I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again
It's alright
We can roll in the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds
It's alright
We can roll in the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds
It's alright
We can roll on the clouds
Getting high
We can float in the clouds

Keep thundering, thundering
I'm wondering, wondering why you keep thundering
Won't you fucking just rain?
And get it over with

And get it over with
I see you rolling it
Let's get it over with
Get high and float again
Roll up and go again

Say now don't complain
Look up, the sun is just a cloud away
