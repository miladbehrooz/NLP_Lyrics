It's the beautiful, Miss Rihanna

Now this be the last time you did me wrong
No more laying up in your arms
No calling, saying you want me back
I'm packing my bags, what you think about that?

Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar
Got me crying

Oh, you got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And you can be mad at me all you want
I ain't coming in, I'll be waiting out front
Coming out the door with your girlfriend
You did me wrong, boy, tell me where our love went

Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissing at the bar
Got me crying

Oh, you got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Now this is the sound of a broken heart
There's only one reason why we're apart
She never woulda made it to your car
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
We would still have us
I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
But now we're, now we're like whoa

Oh, you got me hating on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
But now, now we're like whoa
You got me hating on the club
You took my love
Oh, you took my love

You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on theâ
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on theâ
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on theâ
Club, club, club, club
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on theâ
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on theâ
You got her hating, oh, you got her hating on theâ
