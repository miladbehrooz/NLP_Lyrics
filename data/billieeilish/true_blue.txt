
Lights out
You're not here holding me
I count
Every tear down my cheek
Instead of sheep

Sleep walk
Find myself on your street
Three knocks
Ring the bell then I leave

I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

Cold days
Frozen lake in the park
Old ways
Make mistakes when I'm lost
Now it goes

Bad dreams
Might not mean anything
But you seem
Not to need anything

I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue

I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
I tried a little black and white but I'm so blue
I'd like to mean it when I say I'm over you
But that's still not true

And I'm still so blue
True blue, true blue, hey
True blue
