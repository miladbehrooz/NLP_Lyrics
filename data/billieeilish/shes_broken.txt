
Another story
Of girl meets boy
And gets destroyed

Another promise
Broken in two
The lucky view
Of fiction

Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story
Of girl meets boy

He's okay
She's broken
He's the ocean waves
She's choking

Fade away, fade away
Teach me how to fade away
Another story
Of girl meets boy

So picture perfect
It can't be real
And all you feel is numb

You see them talking
But hear no sound
To hit the ground and
(Fade)...

He's okay
She's broken
He's the ocean waves
She's choking

(Don't need it, d-don't need it)...
Don't want it, don't need it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it, don't want it
Don't want it, don't need it, don't want it
