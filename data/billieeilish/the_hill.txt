When you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn't have to make all those mistakes and be wise
Please try to be patient and know that I'm still learning
I'm sorry that you have to see the strength inside me burning

But where are you, my angel, now?
Don't you see me crying?
I know that you can do it all
But you can't say I'm not trying
