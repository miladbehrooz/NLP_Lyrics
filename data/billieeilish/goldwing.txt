"Smiling On Him, She Beareth Him To Highest Heav'n"
"With Yearning Heart On Thee We Gaze O' Gold Wing'd Messenger Of Mighty Gods"

Gold winged
Angel
Go home
Don't tell
Anyone
What you are, you're sacred
And they're starved, and their art
Is getting dark, and there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart

You better keep your head down
Better keep your head down
They're gonna' tell you what you wanna hear, then they're gonna disappear
Gonna' claim you like a souvenir
Just to sell you in a year
You better keep your head down
Keep your head down
Better keep your head down
Keep your head down
That's good
