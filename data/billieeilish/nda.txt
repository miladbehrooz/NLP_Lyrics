
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? No
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet

I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA

Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
(Once was good enough)
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say

You couldn't save me but you can't let me go
I can crave you but you don't need to know

Thirty under thirty for another year
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it here
Maybe I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear

I've been having fun getting older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something he can cry about
I thought about my future but I want it now
Want it now
(You can't give me up)

You couldn't save me but you can't let me go
I can crave you but you don't need to know

Did I take it too far?
Now I know what you are
You hit me so hard
I saw stars
Think I took it too far
When I sold you my heart
How'd it get so dark?
I saw stars
Stars
