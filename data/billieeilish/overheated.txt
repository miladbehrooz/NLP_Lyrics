
I don't really even know how it happened
I started talking
They started laughing

I don't really even know how it happened
I started watching
Them photographing

I don't really (I don't really) how it happened
Instead of stopping
They still were flashing (I don't really)
I started walking (I don't really)
Gave no reaction
No reaction

I'm overheated
Can't be defeated
Can't be deleted
Can't un-believe it
I'm overheated
Can't be defeated
Can't be deleted
Can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated

I don't really wanna know why it went there
I kinda don't care
You wanna kill me?
You wanna hurt me?
Stop being flirty
It's kinda workin'

Did you really think
"This is the right thing to do"?
Is it news?
News to who?
That I really look just like the rest of you

I'm overheated
Can't be defeated
Can't be deleted
Can't un-believe it
I'm overheated
Can't be defeated
Can't be deleted
Can't be repeated
I'm overheated

And everybody said it was a let down
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now am I?
(Am I?)
Am I?
All these other inanimate bitches
It's none of my business
But don't you get sick of
Posing for pictures
With that plastic body?

Man
I'm overheated
Can't be defeated
Can't be deleted
Can't un-believe it
I'm overheated
Can't be defeated
Can't be deleted
Can't be repeated
I'm overheated
