
It's not true, tell me I've been lied to
Cryin' isn't like you
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through

Maybe won't you take it back
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say I love you
I love you
And I don't want to

Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry

Maybe won't you take it back
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say I love you
I love you
And I don't want to

The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dyin'

We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can't escape the way I love you
I don't want to
But I love you
