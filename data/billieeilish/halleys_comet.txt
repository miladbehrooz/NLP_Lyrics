
I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few

Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you

I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3 AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you than nights could ever be alone

I was good at feeling nothing, now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do

I've been loved before, but right now, in this moment
I feel more and more like I was made for you
For you

I'm sitting in my brother's room
Haven't slept in a week
Or two (Or two)
I think I might have fallen in love
What am I to do?
