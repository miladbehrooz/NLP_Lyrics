
Home alone
Trying not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue
She would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm going back to therapy

'Cause I loved you then and I love you now and I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know
When nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about
When I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal

But I loved you then and I love you now and I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know
When nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you

Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should but I could never hate you
