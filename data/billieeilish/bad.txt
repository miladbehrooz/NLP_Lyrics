
Your butt is mine, I'm gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
I'm giving you on count of three
To show your stuff or let it be
'Cause I'm telling you just watch your mouth
I know your game what you're about

But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you've seen nothing
So just wait till I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?

The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands

But they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
So just wait till I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, c'mon
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm really really bad
And the whole world's got to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
Who's bad?
