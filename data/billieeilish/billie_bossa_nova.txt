
Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts
(It starts)

I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide

You better lock your phone
And look at me when you're alone
Won't take a lot to get you going
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know

It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression
Nobody saw me in the lobby
Nobody saw me in your arms

I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like

You better lock your phone
And look at me when you're alone
Won't take a lot to get you going
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know

You better lock your door
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waiting for
That heavy breathing on the floor
I'm yours, I'm yours
(I'm yours)

I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
