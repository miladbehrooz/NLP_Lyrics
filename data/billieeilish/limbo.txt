
I'm not crying on the phone when you call
What's the use in begging you to stay?
I'm not trying to save us anymore
Cut me loose, 'cause you're too far away

To make me feel better
And make it alright
To give me your sweater
Hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo
Push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
Seven days in limbo
Seven days

I'll give all my weapons to you
We've said it all. No more bones to break
I'm done thinking that we might just spark enough
We're broken glass waiting to be washed away

Can't make me feel better
Make it alright
Give me your sweater
Hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo
Push me out the window

Nothing in common
Nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
Seven days in limbo
Seven days

If you love me
Let me go
If you love me
Leave limbo

Can't make me feel better
And make it alright
Can't give me your sweater
Hold my hand tight
Seven days in limbo
Just push me out the window
Nothing in common, nothing to lose
Nothing but problems between me and you
With your arms akimbo
Seven days in limbo
Seven days
