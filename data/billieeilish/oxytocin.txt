
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I love to rub it in like lotion
If you only pray on Sunday
Could you come my way on Monday?
'Cause I like to do things God does
And improve of if she saw us

She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

I can see it clear as day
You don't really need to pray
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away

I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well

Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I need you for the Oxytocin
If you find it hard to swallow
I can loosin' up your collar
'Cause as long as you're still breathin'
Don't you even think of leavin'

I kinda wanna look away, look away, look away
Kinda wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?

I can see it clear as day
You don't really need to pray
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
Other people would have stayed
Other people don't obey
You and me are both the same
You should really run away

Bad things
I wanna do bad things to you
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well
