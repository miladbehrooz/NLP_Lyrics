
In the end, when they're all gone
When the world is silent and the days are long
Just you and I, we'll be alive
We made it, on our own

'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't
(They won't, they won't, they won't)

Baby, I'm still alive
But my heart is beating slow
Baby, tell me I gotta know
Are you okay? You seem too far gone
Infected, standing there all alone

'Cause everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody wants to think they won't
And everybody makes it 'till they don't
And everybody seems to think they won't
(They won't, they won't, they won't)

The best of me, the best of me is you
The best of me, the best of me was you
