Weâre scanning the scene in the city tonight
Weâre looking for you to start up a fight
Thereâs an evil feeling in our brains
But itâs nothing new, you know it drives us insane

Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths

Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

There is no escape and thatâs for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
Youâve always been taking but now youâre giving

Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths

Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy

Our brains are on fire with the feeling to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Donât try running away âcause youâre the one we will find

Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths
Running
On our way
Hiding
You will pay
Dying
One thousand deaths

Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
Searching
Seek and destroy
