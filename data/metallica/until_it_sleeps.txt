
Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run, but it stays right by my side

So tear me open, pour me out
Thereâs things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps

Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feed it once and now it stays
Now it stays

So tear me open but beware
Thereâs things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until Iâm clean

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, so hold me
Until it sleeps

So tell me why youâve chosen me
Donât want your grip
Donât want your greed
Donât want it

Iâll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleeps

It grips you, so hold me
It stains you, so hold me
It hates you, so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you
Until it sleeps

I donât want it

So tear me open but beware
Thereâs things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me... till clean

Iâll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
