
If you're leaving, close the door
Not expecting people, anymore
Hear me grieving, lying on the floor
Whether drunk or dead, I really ain't too sure

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder tale

Had a friend once, in a room
Had a good time, but it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
Found a reason, for the things we had to do

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
Now my room is cold
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
He feels it from his soul, yeah

Yeah yeah
I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale, yeah yeah
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder tale
