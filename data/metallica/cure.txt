He keeps them all within
He must seek no matter how it hurts
So donât fool again

He thinks the answerâs cold and in his hand
He takes his medicine
The man takes another bullet
Heâs been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say,
âI do believeâ

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say
âI do believeâ
âI do believeâ

The lies tempt her and she follows
Again she lets him in
She must believe to fill the hollow
Sheâs been fooled again

Uncross your arms
Take and throw them to the cure, say
âI do believeâ

Uncross your arms now
Take them to it, say,
âI do believeâ
âYeah, I do believeâ

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyoneâs got to have the sickness
âCause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

Betting on the cure
âCause it must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyoneâs got to have the sickness
âCause everyone seems to need the cure
Precious cure

âI do believeâ

Betting on the cure
It must get better than this
Need to feel secure
Itâs got to get better than this
It must get better than this
Betting on the cure
Everyoneâs got to have the sickness
âCause everyone seems to need the cure

âI do believeâ
