
Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
Son, your lifeâs an open book
Donât close it âfore itâs done
The brightest flame burns quickest
Thatâs what I heard her say
A sonâs heartâs owed to mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still

âRebel,â my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
I left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now Iâm coming home
Iâm not all you wished of me
A motherâs love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stoneâs all I see

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still

Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still

Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
