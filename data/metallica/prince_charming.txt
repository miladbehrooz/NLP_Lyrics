
Thereâs a black cloud overhead
Thatâs me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again itâs me
Iâm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
Iâm the little boy that pushes hard and makes it cry

Thereâs a dirty needle in your child
Stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me
Iâm the suit and tie that bleeds the street and still wants more
Iâm the forty-five thatâs in your mouth, Iâm a dirty, dirty whore

Look, itâs me
The one who canât be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, itâs me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Mom! Look, itâs me

And he wants to be called âFatherâ now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms spell me
Spell only me
Iâm the nothing face that plants the bomb and strolls away
Iâm the one who doesnât look quite right as children play

Look, itâs me
The one who canât be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, itâs me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, itâs me

Look up to me,
What to be and what to fear
Look up to me
Look, itâs me. Like what you hear?
See right through me
See the one who canât be free
See right through me
Look, itâs me, what no one wants to see

Now see the black cloud up ahead
Thatâs me
And this poison ivy chokes the tree
Again itâs me
And Iâm the filthy one on Bourbon Street you walk on by
Iâm the little boy that pushes, pushes, makes it cry

Look, itâs me
The one who canât be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see

Hey, look, itâs me
What no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you want to see
Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, itâs me

Hey, Ma
Hey, Ma! Look, itâs me
