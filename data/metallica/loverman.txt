(How much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)

And he's bucking, and braying, and pawing at the floor
(How much longer?)
And he's howling with pain, crawling up the walls
(How much longer?)

There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)
And he's weak with evil and broken by the world
(How much longer?)

And he's shouting your name and asking for more
(How much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)

Loverman!
Since the world began
Forever, Amen
'Til end of time

Take off that dress
I'm coming down
I'm your loverman
'Cause I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am

L is for LOVE, baby
O is for ONLY you that I do
V is for loving VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING that you are
E is for loving almost EVERYTHING that you do
R is for RAPE me
M is for MURDER me
A is for ANSWERING all of my prayers
N is for KNOWING
Your loverman's going
To be the answer to all of yours

Loverman!
'Til the bitter end
While the empires burn down
Forever and ever and ever ever Amen

I'm your loverman
So help me, baby
So help me, baby
'Cause I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
I'm your loverman!

There's a devil crawling along your floor
(How much longer?)
There's a devil crawling along your floor
(How much longer?)
With a trembling heart, he's coming through your door
(How much longer?)
With his straining sex in his jumping paw
(How much longer?)
There's a devil crawling along your floor
(How much longer?)
And he's old and he's stupid and
He's hungry and he's sore
And he's blind and he's lame
And he's dirty and he's poor
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more, gimme more, gimme more
(How much longer?)
There's a devil crawling along your floor

Loverman!
Here I stand
Forever, Amen
'Cause I am, what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am

Forgive me, baby
My hands are tied
And I got no choice
No, no, no, no
I got no choice at all

I'll say it again
L is for LOVE, baby
O is for O yes I do
V is for VIRTUE, so I ain't gonna hurt you
E is for EVEN if you want me to
R is for RENDER unto me, baby
M is for that which is MINE
A is for ANY old how, darling
And N is for ANY old time

Loverman!
I got a masterplan
To take off your dress
And be your man be your man

Seize the throne
Seize the mantle
Seize that crown
'Cause I am, what I am, what I am, what I am plus I am
I'm your loverman!

There's a devil laying by your side
(How much longer?)
There's a devil laying by your side
(How much longer?)
You might think he's asleep
But take a look at his eyes
(How much longer?)
And he wants you, darling, to be his bride
(How much longer?)
There's a devil laying by your side
(How much longer?)
