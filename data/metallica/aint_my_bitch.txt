
Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
Whatâs wrong?
Iâve already heard this song before
You arrived, but now itâs time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ainât my fall
It ainât my call
It ainât my bitch
It ainât my bitch

Down on the sun
Down and no fun
Down and out, where the hell you been?

Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell again

Stand tall
Canât fall
Never even bend at all before
You arrived, but now itâs time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
Why you around?
So useless

It ainât my fall
It ainât my call
It ainât my bitch

Outta my way

Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine

Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of time

Headstrong
Whatâs wrong?
Iâve already heard this song before
You arrived, but now itâs time to kiss your ass goodbye
And now itâs time to kiss your ass goodbye

Dragging me down
While you around?
So useless

It ainât my fall
It ainât my call
It ainât my bitch

No way but down
Why youâre around
No fooling

It ainât my smile
It ainât my style
It ainât my bitch
Oh, it ainât mine

Ainât mine
Your kind
Youâre stepping out of time

Ainât mine
Your kind
Youâre stepping out of time

Taking me down
Why you around
No fooling

It ainât my fall
It ainât my call
It ainât my bitch
You ainât mine
