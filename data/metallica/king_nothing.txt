
Wish I may, wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things youâve chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But thereâs no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castleâs crumbled
And youâre left with just a name

Whereâs your crown,
King Nothing?
Whereâs your crown?

Hot and cold, bought and sold
A heart as hard as gold
Are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may
You wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things youâve chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But thereâs no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castleâs crumbled
And youâre left with just a name
Whereâs your crown, King Nothing?
Whereâs your crown?

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I donât care how

Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But thereâs no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castleâs crumbled
And youâre left with just a name

Whereâs your crown, King Nothing?

Nothing

Youâre just nothing
Whereâs your crown, King Nothing?
Youâre just nothing
Absolutely nothing

Off to never-never land
