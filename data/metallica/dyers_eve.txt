Dear Father
What is this hell you have put me through
Believer
Deceiver
Day in, day out, live my life through you
Pushed onto me whatâs wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Every thought Iâd think youâd disapprove
Curator
Dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
Iâm living blindly

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Time has frozen still whatâs left to be
Hear nothing
Say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee, itâs life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Youâve clipped my wings before I learned to fly
Unspoiled
Unspoken
Iâve outgrown that fucking lullaby
Same thing Iâve always heard from you
Do as I say, not as I do

Innocence
Torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality
Iâm living blindly

Iâm in hell without you
Cannot cope without you two
Shocked at the world that I see
Innocent victim please rescue me

Dear Mother
Dear Father
Hidden in your world youâve made for me
Iâm seething
Iâm bleeding
Ripping wounds in me that never heal
Undying spite I feel for you
Living out this hell you always knew
