
Invisible kid
Never see what he did
Got stuck where he hid
Fallen through the grid

Invisible kid
Got a place of his own
Where heâll never be known
Inward heâs grown

Invisible kid
Locked away in his brain
From the shame and the pain
World down the drain

Invisible kid
Suspicious of your touch
Donât want no crutch
But itâs all too much

I hide inside
I hurt inside
I hide inside, but Iâll show you...

Iâm OK, just go away
Into the distance let me fade
Iâm OK, just go away
Iâm OK, but please donât stray too far

Open up your heart
Iâm beating right here
Open your mind
Iâm being right here, right now
Open your heart
Iâm beating right here
Open your mind
Iâm being right here, right now

Ooh, what a good boy you are
Out of the way and youâre kept to yourself
Ooh, canât you see that heâs not here
He doesnât want the attention you give
Ooh, unplugging from it all
Invisible kid floats alone in his room
Ooh, what a quiet boy you are
He looks so calm floating âround and âround in himself
