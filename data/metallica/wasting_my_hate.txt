
Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Donât waste, waste your breath
And I wonât waste my hate on you

Ainât gonna waste my hate
Ainât gonna waste my hate on you
I think Iâll keep it for myself

Ainât gonna give no more
Ainât got the time to help you score
I think itâs time you pleased yourself
Yourself

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Donât waste, waste your breath
And I wonât waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Hate

You think youâre worthy now?
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two-pronged crown?

Well I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in beat
But where the hellâs my mind going now?
Dead gone now

Good day. How do?
And I send a smile to you
Donât waste, waste your breath
And I wonât waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you

Think Iâll keep it for myself
