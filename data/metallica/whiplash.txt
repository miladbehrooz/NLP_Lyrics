
Late at night, all systems go
Youâve come to see the show
We do our best, youâre the rest
You make it real, you know
There is a feeling deep inside
That drives you fuckinâ mad
A feeling of a hammerhead
You need it oh so bad

Adrenaline starts to flow
Youâre thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really sore
In a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
Itâs hot as hell tonight

Adrenaline starts to flow
Youâre thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash

Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, kicks your face
Exploding feeling nears
Nowâs the time to let it rip
To let it fuckinâ loose
Weâre gathered here to maim and kill
âCause this is what we choose

Adrenaline starts to flow
Youâre thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac

Here we go

Whiplash

The show is through, the metalâs gone
Itâs time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
But weâll never stop
Weâll never quit
âCause weâre Metallica

Adrenaline starts to flow
Youâre thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
