
Sleep and dream of this
Death angelâs kiss
Brings final bliss
Completely

Empty they say
Death, wonât you let me stay? 

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...

...Suicide
Iâve already died
Youâre just the funeral 
Iâve been waiting for

...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Wait, wait patiently
Your death black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading oâer me

Empty they say
Death, wonât you let me stay? 

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...

...Suicide
Iâve already died
Youâre just the funeral 
Iâve been waiting for

...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Say, is that rain or are they tears?
That has stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after life

An air of freshly broken ground
A concrete angel lit right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
Itâs peace at last, oh peace at last!

Empty they say
Death, wonât you let me stay? 

Empty they say
Death, hear me call your name
Call your name...

...Suicide
Iâve already died
Youâre just the funeral 
Iâve been waiting for

...Cyanide
Living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore

Forevermore
Forevermore
Itâs just the funeral 
Iâve been waiting for
