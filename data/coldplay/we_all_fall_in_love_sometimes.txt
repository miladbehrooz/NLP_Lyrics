Looks like rain today
Crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the steepy subway trains
Heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
Starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something's happened
It's so strange this feeling

Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we, couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says:
"Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes?"

Wise men say
Looks like rain today
Crackled on the speakers
Trickled down the sleepy subway trains
Heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love sometimes
We all fall in love, sometimes
