
Been around the world, the wonders to view
Been around the world, looking for someone like you
Pyramids try, Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I never say die, aim never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

Been around the world, the universe too
Been around flying, baby, it's nothing I wouldn't do
Tanzaku stars, Lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you right
When the storm comes through

'Cause I never say die, aim never untrue
Never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah!

'Cause you reign, all 'cause you reign
All 'cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through

Sayin my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
It's my only weapon, army of one
Sayin my heart is my gun, army of one
