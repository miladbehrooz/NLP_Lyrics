How do they make Christmas nice, when they ain't got no snow and ice?
And what about poor Santa's sleigh?
He has to come from fucking miles away
And what about Mick Dundee?
Well he ain't got no Christmas tree

Well they say, Christmas here is so much fun
We got surfing, we got sun
Christmas here's sweet as a peach
Opening presents on the beach
We got barbies, we got beer
Santa wishes he lived here
Loads of laughter, loads of booze
Christmas with the kangaroos

Well have you ever stopped to wonder how they do Christmas there down under?
Have you ever stopped to think "Do they have much pumpkin drink?"
Oh don't you just find it shocking?
Have you got Tim Tams in your stocking?
Do you wonder where Jesus was born?
No, they got Kylie, they got Shane Warne

They all say Christmas here is so much fun
We got surfing, we got sun
Christmas here's sweet as a peach
Opening presents on the beach
Yeah 'cause got barbies, we got beer
Santa wishes he lived here
Loads of laughter, loads of booze
Christmas with the kangaroos

Loads of laughter, loads of booze
That's Christmas with the kangaroos
