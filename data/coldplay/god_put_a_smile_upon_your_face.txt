I've got to say I'm on my way down
God give me style and give me grace
God put a smile upon my face

Where do we go to draw the line?
I've got to say I wasted all your time
Honey honey
Where do I go to fall from grace?
God put a smile upon your face, yeah

Ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out I wanted to
Ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face ah yeah

Ah, when you work it out I'm worse than you
Yeah, when you work it out I want it to
Ah, when you work out where to draw the line
Your guess is as good as mine

It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine
It's as good as mine

As good as mine, as good as mine
As good as mine, as good as mine

Where do we go? Nobody knows
Don't ever say you're on your way down when
God gave you style and gave you grace
And put a smile upon your face
