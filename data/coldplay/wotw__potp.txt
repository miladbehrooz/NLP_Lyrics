
In a world gone wrong
I shall be strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people

Im in my room
My faith is strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people

In our world tonight
Let's get it right
And I will the strength
Of an eagle
In our world tonight
I might be right
Wonder of the world, power of the people

Ooh...
Ooh...
