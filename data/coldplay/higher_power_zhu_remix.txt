
Sometimes I just can't take it
Sometimes I just can't take it and it isn't alright
I'm not gonna make it
And I think my shoe's untied (Ooh-ooh)
I'm like a broken record
I'm like a broken record and I'm not playin' right
Drocer nekorb a ekil mi
'Til you tell me on your heavenly phone

To hold tight
Come on, come on
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Come on, come on
Yeah, don't let go oh, oh, oh-oh
Hold tight, hold tight
Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
"It's alright, it's alright" she said
I've got my hands up shakin' just to let you know

That you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second, dancing every hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know, ooh

This boy is electric
This boy is electric and you're sparklin' like the universe connected
And I'm buzzin' night after night after night (Oh-oh)
This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you're circuiting through
I'm so happy that I'm alive
Happy I'm alive at the same time as you

'Cause you've got a higher power
Got me singing every second, dancing every hour
Oh yeah, you've got a higher power
And you're really someone I wanna know
(I wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)

You've got
You've got
You've got
You've got
You've got
You've got
You've got
