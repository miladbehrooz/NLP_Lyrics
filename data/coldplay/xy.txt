
Trying hard to speak and
Fighting with my weak hand
Driven to distraction
So part of the plan

When something is broken
And you try to fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way you can

I dive in at the deep end
She become my best friend
I wanna love you
But I don't know if I can

I know something is broken
And I'm tryna fix it
Trying to repair it
Any way I can

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space

You and me are floating on a tidal wave
Together
You and me are drifting into outer space
And singing
