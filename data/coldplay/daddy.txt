
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?
Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you want to say?

I know
You're hurting too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I want to say

You're so far away
Oh and you're so far away
That's okay
That's okay
I'm okay

Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you okay?
Look Dad, we've got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I want to say

Is you're so far away
Oh and you're so far away
That's okay
It's okay
It's okay

You're so far away

Won't you come and won't you stay?
Please stay
Oh, please stay
Won't you come and won't you stay?
One day
Just one day
