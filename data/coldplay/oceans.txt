
Wait for your call, love
The call never came
Ready to fall up
Ready to claim
I'm ready for it all, love
Ready for the pain

Meet under sun and
Meet me again
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
The rain

Behind the walls, love
I'm trying to change
And I'm ready for it all, love
I'm ready for the change

Meet me in blue sky
Meet me again
In the rain
The rain
The rain
In the rain
The rain

Got to find yourself alone in this world
Got to find yourself alone
