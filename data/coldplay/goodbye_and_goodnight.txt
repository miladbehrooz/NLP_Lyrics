
Look how far the river took us.
How far the river took my son.
But the boats gone round the harbor,
And I gotta know the sinner
And I wait.

There's a boat going down the road and sea
A tumble will begin
Its the world you're living in.

The boat will sign the bottom,
And I hit down the button,
Oh, I can't describe the stage you put me in.
Oh, yeah.

And I'm so sorry,
I've been known to hurry
And baby I hope that I'm sorry
Cause tonight
