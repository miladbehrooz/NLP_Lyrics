
Boys
Boys don't cry
Boys keep it all inside
I tried to hide it underneath
Still my heart starts to beat

My human heart
Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart

Oh my human heart
Night and day and light and dark
Any day it could be torn in half
Only got a human heart

Girls can make believe
Girls wear it on the sleeve
Thought I could pretend for trying's sake
Still my heart had to break

My human heart
Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart

Oh my human heart
Night and day and light and dark
Any day it could be torn in half
Only got a human heart
