
And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call

'When you're tired of racing
And you find you never left the start
Come on, baby, don't let it break your heart.'

Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball.
And a slow burning tide
Through my veins is flowing.
From my shipwreck I heard her call
And she said,

'When you're tired of aiming your arrows,
Still you never hit the mark
Even in your rains and shadows
Still we're never gonna part.
Come on, baby, don't let it break your heart.'

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart

Don't let it break your heart
