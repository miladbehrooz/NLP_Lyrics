
Maybe I'm just a ghost
Disappear when anybody's close
Go through you when you try to hold
Try to hold me near

Maybe I'm just a ghost
Emptier than anybody knows
Maybe I'm on the ropes
Or I'm not even here

Every time I try to walk through walls
More walls appear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point of tryna raise your voice
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

Maybe I'm a ghost
Just a whisper in a puff of smoke
A secret that nobody knows
No one will ever hear

Or maybe I'm a ghost
Specter on a roller-coaster
Thorn without a rose
Something people fear

And every time I thought I'd walk through walls
It's all becoming clear
What's the point of feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point of saying 'Rescue me!'
If no one ever hears?
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear

And every time I thought I'd walk through walls
It's all becoming clear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
Every time I try to pull you close
You disappear
