
Oh they say people come
They say people go
This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone
And the world may not know
Still I see you celestial
And I should but I can't let you go

But when I'm cold, cold
When I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me
When I'm in shadow
There's a feeling within me, an everglow

Like brothers in blood
Sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night
We'd be friends 'til we died
But the changing of winds
And the way waters flow
Life as short as the falling of snow
And now I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know you're always with me 
And the way you will show
And you're with me wherever I go
That you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you give me will everglow

[Muhammad Ali:]
God is watching me
God don't praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don't give nothing about Joe Frazier
God don't care nothing about England or America as far as real wealthâ¦ it's all His.
He wants to know how do we treat each other?
How do we help each other?
So, I'm going to dedicate my life to using my name and popularity to helping charities, helping people, uniting people
People bombing each other because of religious beliefs.
We need somebody in the world to help us all make peace.
So when I die â if there's a heaven â I'm gonna see it.
