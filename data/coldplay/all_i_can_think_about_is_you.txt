
One, two, three

Fish fell out of water
Bird stuck on the ground
Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
The whole world on a flight path
Wonder where they'll go, ahhh
Troubles on the outside, I know

But now, all I can think about is you
All I can think about is you
If all that I'm on earth to do
Is solo
Then what a lone poor shoe
I wanna walk in a two

Go
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do

When everything is falling all around you
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only thing left that's true
