
Stuck here, in the middle of nowhere
With a headache and a heavy heart
Well nothing was going quite right here
And I'm tired, I can't play my part

Come on, come on
Oh what a state I'm in
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?

That help is just around the corner for us

Oh my head just won't stop aching
And I'm sat here licking my wounds
And I'm shattered but it really doesn't matter
'Cause my rescue is gonna be here soon

Come on, come on
Oh what a state, I'm in
Come on, come on
Why won't it just sink in?

That help is just around the corner for us
That help is just around the corner for us
Oh that help is just around the corner for us
