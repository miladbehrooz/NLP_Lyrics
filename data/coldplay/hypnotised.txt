
Been rusting in the rubble
Running to a faint
Need a brand new coat of paint
I found myself in trouble
Thinking about what ain't
Never gonna be a saint

Saying float like an eagle
Fall like the rain
Pouring to put out the pain
Oh again and again

Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I slip and I'm mesmerized

It's easy to be lethal
I'm learning from the news
It's a guidebook for the blues
Saying it's the very same steeple
People want to choose
They just see it from different views

And threading the needle
Fixing my flame
Oh now I'm moved to exclaim
Oh again and again

How I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I trip, when I look in your eyes
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift and I'm mesmerized

Oh again and again
Now I'm hyp, hypnotised
Yeah I lift to a permanent high
Oh I'm hyp, hypnotised
It was dark
Now it's sunrise
