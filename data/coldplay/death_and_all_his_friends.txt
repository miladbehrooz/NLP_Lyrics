
All winter we got carried
Away over on the roof tops. Let's get married
All summer we just hurried
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry
So come over, just be patient, and don't worry

So come over, just be patient, and don't worry

And don't worry

No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends

No, I don't want a battle from beginning to end
I don't want a cycle of recycled revenge
I don't want to follow death and all of his friends

And in the end, we lie awake
And we dream of making our escape

And in the end, we lie awake
And we dream of making our escape
