
I am dreaming of when I get back to Houston
I am dreaming of that fair and special place
I am dreaming of when Houston has no problems
In that city where they send you into space

I am dreaming of when I get back to Texas
Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There's a harmony that harms down there in Houston
Oh, Houston you got to keep on keeping on

From Miami we are sending love to Houston
We are praying that you make it through the rain
I know nothing's gonna break the will of Houston
Oh, and we can't wait to go down there again

I am dreaming of when I get back to Texas
Corpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston
There's a harmony that harms down there in Houston
Oh, Houston you got to keep on keeping on

Take it Jon!

Oh, Houston got to keep on keeping on
Yeah, Houston got to keep on keeping on
