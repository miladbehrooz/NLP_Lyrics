
(So I race for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart, bo-boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

So, I put my hands up to the sky
I feel alive
I've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
I put my hands up to the sky
That's alright
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I race for it)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart bo-boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, masterpiece
Been innocent but a sinner in me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky
I feel alive
I've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
I put my hands up to the sky
Feeling inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

Put my hands up to the sky
Feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky
I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I race for it)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I race for it)
And I know, and I know, and I know
I know what I've got
(So I race for it)
X marks the spot

So, I put my hands up to the sky
I feel alive
I've got a rocket ship that I wanna ride
I put my hands up to the sky
Feeling inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

Put my hands up to the sky
Feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky
I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
