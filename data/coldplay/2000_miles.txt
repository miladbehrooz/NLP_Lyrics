
She's gone 2000 miles
It's very far
The snow came down
Gets colder day by day
I miss her

I hear children singing
Felt like Christmastime

In these frozen and silent nights
Sometimes in a dream... you appear
Outside under the purple sky
Diamonds in the snow... sparkle

Our hearts were singing
It felt like Christmastime

2000 miles
Is very far through the snow
I'll think of you
Wherever you go

2000 miles
It's very far through the snow
I'll think of you
Whenever you go

She's gone 2000 miles
It's very far
The snow came falling down
Gets colder day by day
I miss you

I hear people singing
It felt like Christmastime
I heard people singing
It felt like Christmastime
I heard people singing
It felt like Christmastime
I heard people singing
It felt like Christmas time
