
To my surprise
And my delight
I saw sunrise
I saw sunlight

I am nothing
In the dark
And the clouds burst
To show daylight

Oooh, and the sun shine
Yeah, on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who couldn't live without
Oooh, come apart without it

On a hilltop
On a sky-rise
Like a firstborn
Child

And at full tilt
And in full flight
Defeat darkness
Breaking daylight

Oooh, and the sun shine
Yeah on this heart of mine
Oooh, and I realise
Who cannot live without
Oooh, come apart without
Daylight

Slowly breaking through the daylight [x22 to fade]
