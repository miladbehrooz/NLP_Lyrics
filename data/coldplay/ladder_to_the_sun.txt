
There it started, came apart it, broke up into pieces and
There was a chance I missed it, it [?] so I put myself into your hands

Cause you're not just anyone, you're a ladder to the sun
Oh you're not just anyone, you're a ladder to the sun

And I could run my courses with opposing forces you said all men are mortals and,
So if you want me you can have me, take me baby grab me, yes if you want me you can have me

Cause you're not just anyone, you're a ladder to the sun
Oh you're not just anyone, you're a ladder to the sun

Oh now boy what you've been and done you set a course for a silver sun
Oh now boy what you've been and done

I had it all and I risked it a chance and I missed it
I had it all and, I risked it all,
Oh I risked it all

A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
I had it all and I risked it all,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
A ladder to the, a ladder to the sun,
I had it all and I risked it all
