
Now I never meant
To do you wrong
That's what I came here to say

But if I was wrong
Then I'm sorry
I don't let it stand in our way

'Cause my head just aches
When I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done

But life is for living
We all know
And I don't wanna live it alone

Sing
Ah, ah, oh
Sing
Ah, ah, oh
And just sing
Ah, ah, oh
