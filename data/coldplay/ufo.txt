
Lord I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river gonna flow
It just seems that upstream I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

And that light hits your eye
I know, I swear,
We'll find somewhere the streets are paved with gold
Bullets fly, split the sky
But that's alright
Sometimes sunlight
Comes streaming through the holes

Oh, oh
