
They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to

They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful what it is you're tryin' to do

And be careful when you're walking into view
Just be careful when you're walking into view

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one onâ¦

They got one eye watching you
One on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true

D-d-don't believe a word
It's just us against the world
And we just gotta turn up to be heard

Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one

You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting
While my left hides under the chairs

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you

Ooh-ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh-oooh-oooh

Got one eye on the road and one on you
