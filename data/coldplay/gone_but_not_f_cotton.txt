
Yesterday I woke up to the news
I was very very sad to hear
My favourite show would disappear, and
Today I'm filling up with blues
Though I'm happy that her tummy's growing
A DJ that we love is going

How'm I gonna make it from 10 through to 1?
And how'm I gonna tell her we'll miss her a tonne?
How to tell her thanks for the records she played?
Thanks for introducing us to Lana del Rey
Thanks for the stories and all the good times
Festival tales, Kilimanjaro climbs
Thanks for all the mornings, in the Lounge we'd arrive
And sweetly you'd tell us, "No swearing, we're live!"
Oh Fearne you made all of my mornings fly
Like the sun bursting through a cloudy sky
And you'll be great at anything that you wanna try
Now it's hard, but it's time for us to say goodbye

Goodbye
Goodbye
