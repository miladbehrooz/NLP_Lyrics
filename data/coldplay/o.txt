
Flock of birds
Hovering above
Just a flock of birds
That's how you think of love

And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

Flock of birds
Hovering above
Into smoke I'm turned
And rise following 'em up

Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
'Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive
Next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on

So fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you
Fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I can fly with you

Fly on
Fly on
Fly on

Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go
Don't ever let go
