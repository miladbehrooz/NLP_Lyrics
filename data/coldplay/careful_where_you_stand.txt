
I feel safe
I feel warm
When you're here, can I do no wrong?
I am cured, when I'm by your side
I'm alright, yes I'm alright

I'm safe when I am with you
And I feel warm if you want me to
I am cured, when I'm by your side
I'm alright

Careful where you stand, my love
Careful where you lay your head
It's true we're always
Looking out for one another

I feel safe when I'm with you
And I feel warm when you want me too
I am cured when you are around
I'm alright

Careful where you stand, my love
Careful where you lay your head
It's true, we're always
Looking out for one another

So I'd like a quiet time, please
I'd like a quiet time

Oh now now
Oh now now
And careful where you stand
And careful where you stand
