
Boys, boys don't cry
Boys keep it all inside
I try to hide it underneath
Still my heart starts to beat

My human heart
Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart
Oh my human heart
Night and day, light and dark
Any day could be torn in half
Only got a human heart

Girls, can make believe
Girls wear it on their sleeve
Thought I could pretend for trying sake
Still, my heart had to break

My human heart
Only got a human heart
I wish it didn't run away
I wish it didn't fall apart
Oh my human heart
Night and day, light and dark
Any day could be torn in half
Only got a human heart
