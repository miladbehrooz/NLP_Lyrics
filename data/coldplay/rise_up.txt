
Sometimes it falls upon a generation to be great
I ask all humanity now to rise up
Then we can all stand with our heads held high
To rise up
To rise up
To rise up

You have a limited time to stay on earth
You must try to use that period
For the purpose of transforming your country into what you desire it to be
A democratic, non-racial, non-sexist country
And that is a great task
To rise up
To rise up
To rise up
