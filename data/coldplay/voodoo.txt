[Chris Martin & Tiwa Savage:]
Am I sick in my mind?
I think about you all of the time
All day you're inside
Oh oh oh, it kind of blows my mind
It blurs, it blinds
'Cause deep down desire
Oh, don't you know I walk through fire
With which dark disease
Don't let me go

[Chris Martin:]
To share it
'Cause you set me free
When you work your magic on me
Oh it's so surreal
Voo-voodoo
To share it
Put a spell on me
'Cause when you work your magic, I'm free
Oh yeah, I know you do
Voo-voodoo

[Wizkid:]
Get on the bounce (uh huh) all night long (uh huh)
Work your magic (uh huh) all on me (on me)
Get on the bounce (work it out) all night long (work it out)
Work your magic (work it out) all on me

[Danny Ocean:]
Ella es viento y fuego
Mi corazÃ³n hechizÃ³
Ella me hizo un voodoocito
AsÃ­ dentro de mÃ­, ay
Su magia puro amor
Sin truquitos o no
No, ay baby quÃ© divino
Wah, wah, wah, wah, baby
Wah, wah, wah, wah
You got fire, fire
Hey, puro fueguito lo que hay aquÃ­
Wah, wah, wah, wah, baby
Wah, wah, wah, wah
You got fire, fire
Puro fueguito baby

[Chris Martin & Tiwa Savage:]
Oh, how do you do that voodoo that you do?
Oh, how do you do that voodoo that you do? (Voo-voodoo)
Oh, how do you do that voodoo that you do?
Oh, how do you do that voodoo that you do? (Voo-voodoo)
