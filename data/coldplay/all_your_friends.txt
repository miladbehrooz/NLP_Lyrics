
On and on
You're told which side you're on
Ahh
You're forced you're thrown
To become the scythe to cut the corn

Ahh
And all your friends they ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset and away they go
All your friends they ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset and away they're thrown
Into the fire

Ten below
The call comes on the radio
Ahh
Over you go
And the red now all the rivers flow, the poppies grow

Ahh
All your friends they ride into the sunset
Fly into the sunset and away they blow
And all your friends they ride into the sunset
Ride into the sunset and they're taken home
Open fire
Open fire

Open fire
Open fire
Open fire
Just to ride and fire
