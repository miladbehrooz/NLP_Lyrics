
Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
And I come here to talk
I hope you understand

The green eyes
Yeah the spotlight
Shines upon you

And how could anybody
Deny you?

I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter
Now I met you

And honey you should know
That I could never go on
Without you

Green eyes

Honey you are the sea
Upon which I float
And I came here to talk
I think you should know

That green eyes
You're the one that I wanted to find
And anyone who tried to deny you
Must be out of their mind

Because I came here with a load
And it feels so much lighter since I met you

Honey you should know
That I could never go on
Without you

Green eyes, green eyes

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Honey you are a rock
Upon which I stand
