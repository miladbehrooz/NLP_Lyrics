
Smoke is rising from the houses
People burying their dead
I ask somebody what the time is
But time doesn't matter to them yet

People talking without speaking
Trying to take what they can get
I ask you if you remember
Prospekt, how could I forget?

Drums, here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
As fish swimming round in a barrel?
When you've got the gun

Oh and I run, here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get behind some kind of control
But I wasn't one

But here am I on my own in a separate sky
And here I lie on my own in a separate sky

I don't wanna die on my own here tonight
And here I lie on my own in a separate sky
