
I wanna live life
And never be cruel
I wanna live life
And be good to you
And I wanna fly
And never come down
And live my life
And have friends around

We never change, do we?
No, no
We never learn, do we?
So I wanna live in a wooden house
I wanna live life and always be true
I wanna live life and be good to you

I wanna fly
And never come down
And live my life
And have friends around

We never change, do we?
No, no
We never learn, do we?
So I wanna live in a wooden house
And making more friends would be easy

Oh and I don't have a soul to save
Yes and I sin every single day
We never change, do we?
We never learn, do we?

So I wanna live in a wooden house
Where making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out
