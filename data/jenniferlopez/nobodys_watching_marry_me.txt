
Diamonds on the necklace, everything else is off
Now we wanna bet he can beat me to the bed, oh no
When no one's around we do some things, do it for pleasure
We hide from the night to morning light, feels like forever

Right here by the light of the moon
Spotlight on you got me zooming
I'm falling into you

We're dancing on tabletops, neighbors calling the cops
When I'm with you, feels like
Nobody's watching us
We're burning down all the clocks, hoping that time will stop
Lock out the world tonight
Like nobody's watching us
Nobody's watching us

No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us

Mmm, there could be a million people
But my eyes are only locked on you (Yeah, yeah)
You got tunnel vision for me when I move
Putting on a show, that's what we do
And we don't sleep at night
Got adrenaline going through the bloodstream
Don't sleep at night, nah nah

Right here by the light of the moon
Spotlight on you got me zooming
I'm falling into you (Falling, oh)

We're dancing on tabletops, neighbors calling the cops
When I'm with you, feels like
Nobody's watching us
We're burning down all the clocks, hoping that time will stop
Lock out the world tonight
Like nobody's watching us
Nobody's watching us

No, nobody's watching (Oh no)
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us (Nobody's watching us)

No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us (No, no)

Right here by the light of the moon
Spotlight on you got me zooming
I'm falling into you

We're dancing on tabletops, neighbors calling the cops
When I'm with you, feels like
Nobody's watching us
We're burning down all the clocks, hoping that time will stop
Lock out the world tonight
Like nobody's watching us
Nobody's watching us

No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us

No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us
No, no, no, no
