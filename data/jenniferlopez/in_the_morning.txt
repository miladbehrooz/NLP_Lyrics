
If you love me
Say it in the morning
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body

Sweet little white lies
Your sweet little white lies
Leave a bad taste in my mouth
Your taste in my mouth (Come on)
Queen in the night time
Black dress with white wine
Mess it up, watch it fall down
When you watch it fall down

You tell me I'm a real one, I'm the right one
But only when you're on one
You tell me that you need me, wanna see me
But only when you want some, want some

Yeah, if you love me
Say it in the morning
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body
Baby, love me like you mean it
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body

Na ma na, na ma na, eh
Na ma na, na ma na, eh

Hands cover my neck (Uh)
Hold tight 'cause you're obsessed
Come get it in when you're out
Get it in when you're out
Go down in the dim light
You love it 'cause it's so tight
So you better lock it down
You know you better lock it down

You tell me I'm a real one, I'm the right one
But only when you're on one
You tell me that you need me, wanna see me
But only when you want some, want some

Yeah, if you love me
Say it in the morning
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body
Baby, love me like you mean it
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body

Na ma na, na ma na, eh
Na ma na, na ma na, eh
Na ma na, na ma na, eh
Only when you want my body, want my body
Na ma na, na ma na, eh (Ooh)
Na ma na, na ma na, eh (Na na na)
Na ma na, na ma na, eh
Only when you want my body, want my body

Sweet little white lies
Your sweet little white lies
Leave a bad taste in my mouth
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

If you love me (If you love me)
Say it in the morning (Say it in the)
Not just in the evening (Ooh)
Only when you want my body, want my body
Baby, love me like you mean it (Like you mean it)
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body, yeah
