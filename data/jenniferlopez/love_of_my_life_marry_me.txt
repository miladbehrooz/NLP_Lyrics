
You know I tried so long
Every time I thought I found it, I was wrong
I swear I must have spent a thousand nights
Looking for somebody who could hold me tight
Until I realized

I am the love of the love of my life
I am the love of the love of my life
I ain't got nobody else on my mind
I am the love of the love of my life

I was just waiting for you, waiting for you, waiting for you
All my life praying for you, praying for you, praying for you
All that I wanted was someone to come and sit up at my table for two
I was just waiting for you (Waiting for you, waiting for you)

I don't know how I fell in...
I don't know why, don't know why
And now I'll pick myself up
One more time, one more time

You know I tried so long
Every time I thought I found it, I was wrong
I swear I must have spent a thousand nights
Looking for somebody who could hold me tight
Until I realized

I am the love of the love of my life
I am the love of the love of my life
I ain't got nobody else on my mind
I am the love of the love of my life

I was just waiting for you, waiting for you, waiting for you
All my life changing for you, changing for you, changing for you
I didn't realize that it could be better and better than I ever knew
I was just waiting for you (Waiting for you, waiting for you)

I don't know how I fell in...
I don't know why, don't know why
And now I'll pick myself up
One more time, one more time

You know I tried so long
Every time I thought I found it, I was wrong
I swear I must have spent a thousand nights
Looking for somebody who could hold me tight
Until I realized

I am the love of the love of my life
I am the love of the love of my life
I ain't got nobody else on my mind
I am the love of the love of my life

Now I see loving me
Is enough
Now you see the real me
You're in love

I am the love of the love of my life (Love)
I am the love of the love of my life (Love)
I ain't got nobody else on my mind
I am the love of the love of my life (Love)
I am the love of the love of my life
