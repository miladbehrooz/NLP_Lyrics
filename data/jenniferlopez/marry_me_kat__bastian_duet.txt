Shelter from a broken paradise

True love got a ring, ring, ring
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring
This queen need a king, king, king
For life, for life, for life
True love got a ring, ring, ring (Ring, ring)
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring (Ring, ring)
Angel's gonna sing, sing, sing
Tonight, tonight, tonight

We could tie it up tonight, no patience
Take my last name, put it where your name is
Have they ever seen a love this famous?
They never, no, they never
This forever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Ain't nobody do it better, better, better
And it's only getting better

You're the queen, I'll be the king, king, king
For life, for life, for life (For life)
