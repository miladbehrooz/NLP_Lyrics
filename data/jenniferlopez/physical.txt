[Enrique Iglesias:]
You wanna dance
You wanna move
I'm on a mission to just take you to the moon
We like to party
We're in the mood
So turn it up and let the music get you loose

[Jennifer Lopez:]
We're feeling high
Gimme that bass
Just get them drinks and put yo' hand up in the air
You know you want me
So make a move
Come over here and show me what you're gonna do

[Enrique Iglesias (Jennifer Lopez):]
Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite
(Tonight we're going all the way)
(You want my lips to kiss the pain away)
(Body to body, we can cause a flame)
(We can ignite, ignite, ignite)
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical
(We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh)
(Physical, physical)

[Jennifer Lopez:]
You make me fly
I'm losing my head
Don't let me come down, pump it up until the end
The club is bumpin'
Blow up the roof
So never mind if we all get a little rude

[Enrique Iglesias:]
Move to the right
Move to the left
Now back it up, you know just what you gonna get
You know you like it
I know you do
So turn it up and let the beat just get you loose

[Enrique Iglesias (Jennifer Lopez):]
(Tonight we're going all the way)
(You want my lips to kiss the pain away)
(Body to body, we can cause a flame)
(We can ignite, ignite, ignite)
Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite
(We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh)
(Physical, physical)
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical

[Enrique Iglesias:]
You wanna dance
You wanna move
I'm on a mission to just take you to my room

[Jennifer Lopez:]
Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical
