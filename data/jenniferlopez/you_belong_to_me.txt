Were you looking for my reaction?
What do you need to know?
Don't you know I'll always be your girl?

You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own

You belong to me
Tell her, tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
You don't even know her
You belong to me
Tell her that I love you
You belong to me

You belong to me
Can it be funny, that you're not sure?
You belong to me
Thought we'd close the book and lock the door

You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell, I can tell, darling

Tell her
You belong to me
Tell her that I love her
You belong to me
You belong, you belong, you belong to me
You belong to me
Tell her, tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
Tell her she don't even know you

Tell her
You belong to me
Tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
I know from a long time ago, baby
You belong to me
Don't make me go to her house
You belong to me
You belong, you belong, you belong to me
You belong to me

You belong to me (You belong to me)
You belong to me (You belong to me)
You belong to me (Mine, you're mine, you belong to me)
You belong to me (You belong to me)
You belong to me (You belong to me)
You belong to me (You belong to me)
You belong to me (You belong to me)
You belong to me (You belong to me)
You belong to me (You belong to me)
