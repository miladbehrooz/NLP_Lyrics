
I'm on my way

Always knew you even when I didn't
Know you, don't make sense, but it do
I was on my way to you
Every teardrop fell so heavy
Hurt like hell but Heaven sent me through
I was on my way to you

And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
I was on my way to you

I'm on my way
On my way
On my way
On my way to you
On my way
On my way to you

Hope was hopeless, faith was running
Didn't notice you were coming through
You were on your way too
And you don't believe in meant-to-be
But somehow you were meant for me, it's true
Yeah, you were on your way too

And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
I was on my way to you

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
On my way
On my way
On my way to you
On my way
On my way to you, oh

And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
On my way to you

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
On my way to you
On my, darling, I'm on my way

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
On my way
On my way
On my way to you
On my way
On my way to you
On my, darling, I'm on my way
