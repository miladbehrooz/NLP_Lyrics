[Trey Songz (Jennifer Lopez):]
Standing here, all at once
All the words run dry
(Something's changed, can't explain)
(And I can't deny)

[Trey Songz:]
Turning in circles and blurring the lines of the unspoken
It's calling us tonight

[Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez:]
I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
'Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light

[Trey Songz {Jennifer Lopez}:]
Close your eyes, when you dream
That's where I will be
{Say it's true} (It's true)
{Say you do} (I do)
Say you do believe

[Trey Songz & Jennifer Lopez:]
The greatest adventures are waiting so patiently
The angels are calling us tonight

I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
'Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light

[Trey Songz (Jennifer Lopez):]
Every shape and all the colors
All the love from all the lovers
Never could express just what you mean to me
(Turning in circles and blurring the lines)
Every word in every sentence
Doesn't seem to make a difference
Nothing can explain just what you mean to me

Oh, no, I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
'Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light

(Every star that's ever fallen)
Knows the way to where we're going
Now I really know just what you mean to me
