
Oh baby, the room stars spinnin'
I think the floors about to meet me
Every single time you step on me
Oh baby, it's beyond butterflies now
It's more like I'm mesmerized now
Can't stay relaxed when you look in my eyes
Ain't even gotta whisper
And my knees get weak
Don't let me see you comin'
I'll forget how to speak
And baby when you're near me
I can't even think
It's like I, oh I think I

I'm about to ooh ooh ooh ooooh faint baby
When I fall, when I see you, can't stand up straight
When I touch you, ohh baby ooh ooh ooh ooooh faint baby
When you do the things you do, you make me wanna
Think I'm gonna faint

Ohh baby, when we gettin' close
Got a feelin', I already know
Ooh, every single time I'm ready to hit the floor
Come and catch me, before I am down
3, 2 and you know I'm out
I'm tryin' to calm down
What you do to me when you're around
Ain't gotta whisper
And my knees get weak
Don't let me see you comin'
I'll forget how to speak
And baby when you're near me
I can't even think
It's like I, oh I think I

I'm about to ooh ooh ooh ooooh faint baby
When I fall, when I see you, can't stand up straight
When I touch you, ohh baby ooh ooh ooh ooooh faint baby
When you do the things you do, you make me wanna
Think I'm gonna faint

Grab a pillow, 'cause I'm about to fall hard
So good, that baby you catch me off my guard
I don't hurt myself if I ever hit the ground
Come catch me
'Cause you got me falling out

Ooh ooh ooh ooooh faint baby
When I fall, when I see you, can't stand up straight
When I touch you, ohh baby ooh ooh ooh ooooh faint baby
When you do the things you do, you make me wanna
Think I'm gonna faint

Faint baby
You make me wanna
Faint
