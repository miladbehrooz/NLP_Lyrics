
Whoa, oh, oh

Guess I should've shut my mouth
But I had to get it out
So much for being headstrong
Now I'm going halfway out my mind
I know I was out of line
No scratch that, I was dead wrong

Know I shoulda let it go
But I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone
But, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back
If I knew all I'd be left with is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas
'Cause you're gone

Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

Heaven knows if you were here
I'd be all up in your ear
Least you could do is answer your phone
'Cause I realized my mistake
And baby, I'll do what it takes
If I could just get you one and one

Shoulda let it go
But I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone
But, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back
If I knew all I'd be left with is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas
'Cause you're gone

Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

I know I pushed you out
Running off at the mouth
Saying all the wrong things
Calling you out your name
I was unpredictable
I was so emotional
But I swear I'm gonna do better (Yeah)
Can we get this back together again?

Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning (Ooh, oh)
It's getting out of control (Out of control)
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight (I don't wanna fight)
I don't care who's right (I don't care who's right)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time (Backing down), I don't wanna fight (I don't wanna fight)
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
I'm wrong when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
So wrong when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm wrong when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Hear me)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

So wrong, hear me
Come back, it seems so long
