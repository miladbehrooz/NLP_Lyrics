
I'm sittin' on top
Of cloud number nine
Yeah, I'm going up, I'm gettin' so high
No, I'm not the same, since you came around
You're testin' my faith, I'm prayin' out loud

(I feel it in my chest) I feel it in my chest
(I got you in my head) I got you in my head
(I'm putting on my best) I'm putting on my best
Like I'm in church, church, church

(I'm falling for you now) Calling out your name
(And I want to make you proud) Got me feeling sane
(So I'm gonna say it loud) It's a new day
Like I'm in church, church, church, church

You make me feel like I'm in Heaven
I'm coming out with my confession
Like church, church, church, church, church, church, church
Like church, church, church, church (Yeah)

I'm down on my knees, I've fallen for you
You've opened my gates, and showed me the truth
I'm born again, I'm feeling renewed
You showed me the way, I'm baptized in you

(I feel it in my chest) I feel it in my chest
(I got you in my head) I got you in my head
(I'm putting on my best) I'm putting on my best
Like I'm in church, church, church

(I'm falling for you now) Screaming out your name
(And I want to make you proud) Got me feeling sane
(So I'm gonna sing it loud) It's a new day
Like I'm in church, church, church, church

You make me sing out hallelujah
This kind of love will do it to ya
Like church, church, church, church, church, church, church
Like church, church, church, church (Yeah)

Ready to say I do, making this woman true
It's the honest to God's truth
Church, church, church, church
Ready to say I do, making this woman true
It's the honest to God's truth
Church, church, church, church

You make me sing out hallelujah (Testify)
This kind of love will do it to ya
Like church, church, church, church, church, church, church
Like church, church, church, church (Yeah)

Yeah baby, I'm in church
Church, church, church with you
Ooh, I'm in church with you
I'm in church with you

Lord, almighty
