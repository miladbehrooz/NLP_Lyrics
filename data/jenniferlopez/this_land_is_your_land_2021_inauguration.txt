
This land is your land, this land is my land
From the California to the New York island
From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me

As I went walking down that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me, oh

This land
This land
This land was made for you and me, oh
This land
Oh, this land
This land was made for you and me
You and me, oh

America America
God shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea

[?] con libertad y [?] para todos

Let's get loud
This land was made for you and me
