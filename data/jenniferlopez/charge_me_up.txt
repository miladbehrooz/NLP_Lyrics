It's a matter of seconds now, I'm shutting down (Oh, whoa-oh)
Desperate when I move
My battery is screaming loud, I'm shutting down (Oh, whoa-oh)

It's an addiction, I, I, I want more, more, more
Give me some boom, boom, boom
Give me some oh, oh, oh
Kick-start my engine with a hundred thousand volts
Ignite the room, room, room
I'm going loco, oh

Stroke me down like lightning bolts
Take control of my body, every single bone
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again
I'm dancing in your danger zone
So wired up, but I just want another dose
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again

This is my disease, my predatory instinct call
I'm about to fall (Oh, whoa-oh)
Shock me fill me up
Proceed I'll give you all you want, I'm 'bout to fall (Oh, whoa-oh)

It's an addiction, I, I, I want more, more, more
Give me some boom, boom, boom
Give me some oh, oh, oh
Kick-start my engine with a hundred thousand volts
Ignite the room, room, room
I'm going loco, oh

Stroke me down like lightning bolts
Take control of my body, every single bone
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again
I'm dancing in your danger zone
So wired up, but I just want another dose
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again

Running real low, I'm moving in slow mo'
Charge me up, shift me up, I need a reload
Running real low, I'm moving in slow mo'
Charge me up, shift me up, I need a reload

Stroke me down like lightning bolts
Take control of my body, every single bone
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again
I'm dancing in your danger zone
So wired up, but I just want another dose
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again

Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again
