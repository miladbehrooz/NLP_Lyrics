[Jack Mizrahi:]
When you're vouging femme, femme, femme
Just to get those tens, tens, tens
You're the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me, crÃ¨me, crÃ¨me
I want you to stop, show 'em

[Jennifer Lopez (Jack Mizrahi):]
Clap, bitches, clap
Clap, bitches, clap
Snap, bitches, snap
Snap
I'm calling out legends, (legends, legends) and stars, stars
I wanna see legends, (legends, legends), statements and stars, (stars)
Hit the floor, girls

[Jack Mizrahi (Jennifer Lopez):]
Stars and the statements and the legends called
Jack's turning this to all-out war
('Cause here I come)
Everybody wanna be a superstar, riding around in a rental car

[Jennifer Lopez:]
I wanna see runway
I wanna see old way
I wanna see new way
I wanna see you slay
Eating the runway, serving the runway, marching the runway
Eat that runway
Eating the runway, serving the runway, marching the runway
Eat that runway, walk

[Jennifer Lopez (Jack Mizrahi):]
Give me your heart, leave it out on the floor
(The icon Jennifer Lopez)
Tonight, you're perfect, you're living, you're so beautiful
(Face, body, sex and attitude)
Tens across the board
Half of us came off a flight
We came together for this one night
I wanna see you leave it all on the floor
Girls get ready 'cause here I come

[Jack Mizrahi (Jennifer Lopez) :]
(Mira, mira sen-seÃ±orita)
(Whether you're black or Puer-Puerto Rican)
(Mira, mira, ball-ball room nation)
(It's about fun, there's no segregation)
Samba, merengue, ooh la la
I make you hot, make you hot, (make you ha ha ha)
Hip-hop, vogue and pop, lock and stop
Let it drop, let it drop, let it drop
Show 'em

[Jennifer Lopez (Jack Mizrahi):]
Where my face kids at?
Where my glam queens at?
Where my real queens at?
You want it, take it to the back
Where my sirens at?
European runway at
Labels and pumps at
You want it, take it to the back
(She don't want it)

On the runway, where we don't play
I want it my way, don't be shady
(You can't take it, darling)
Be a lady, go crazy
On the runway, where we don't play
I want it my way, don't be shady
Be a lady, go crazy

Give me your heart, leave it out on the floor
Tonight, you're perfect, you're living, you're so beautiful
Tens across the board (Tens, tens, tens, tens, tens)
Half of us came off a flight
We came together for this one night
I wanna see you leave it all on the floor
Girls get ready 'cause here I come

(We serve, bitch, we don't work, bitch)
(We serve, bitch)
'Cause here I come

Can I see? Walk for me
Twirl for me, serve for me
Lanvin, Ebony, Icon
Infinity, Comme, Chanel, Balenciaga
Prodigy, Ninja, LaBeija, Milan
Omni, Mizrahi (Woo!), Xtravagazna, GarÃ§on
Mugler

(Look at me, look at me, look at me, bitch)
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, bitch)
(M to the I to the motherfucking Z)
(You can't help but look at me)
The elements, elements
The elements, elements
The elements, elements
All five elements
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, bitch)
(Look at me, look at me, look at me, bitch)
(M to the I to the motherfucking Z)
(You can't help but look at me)
Five, (five), four, (four), three, (three), two, (one)
