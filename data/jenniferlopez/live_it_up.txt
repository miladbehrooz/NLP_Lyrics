[Pitbull:]
From the streets of Miami
To presenting at the Grammies
Con el amulet de Jennifer
Maybe now you understand me

(Clap your hands, go clap your hands
Clap your hands to the beat)
Mr. Worldwide, RedOne, and the beautiful Jennifer Lopez
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands
Clap your hands to the beat)
Dale
We don't believe in defeat
That's why we're back for a three-peat

Hi Jenny, mira que esta loco
Yo me lo como como pastelito coco
I get stupid on a beat, sÃ­ bobo
I got MamÃ­, MamÃ­s by the boatload
Yo tengo la carne, y ella el mojo
I'm saying, "Dale," she's screaming, "YOLO!"
She's little Red Riding Hood
And guess who's the lobo? Me la como
Whose name is globally known?
Whose name's on a check, and they adding an O?
Whose name is on the blimp with the world is yours?
Whose name is on schools, huh? Slam for sure
I know it's hard to understand how a boy grew to a man
Man turned to a brand, but guess what? Here I am
Jenny From the Block, let's rock with a plan

[Jennifer Lopez:]
You push me harder, I'll do the same
Boy, I want to feel you in every way
Don't even wonder, it's just a game
We rocking body-to-body, let's go insane

I hit the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow
Sure you do
I'm in the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow
Sure you do

Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up - So live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping 'til we're done
Live it up - So live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[GÃ¼nther:]
Make love, don't fight
Let's fuck tonight
Let's fuck tonight

[Jennifer Lopez:]
Turn up this mother and let it play
(Mami)
I know you like my bumper, don't be ashamed
(Que rico)
Don't even wonder, it's just a game
(Mami)
We're rocking body-to-body, let's go insane
(Que rico)

I hit the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow
Sure you do
I'm in the spotlight all night, ready to go
Give you a hot night, so tight, ready to blow
Sure you do

Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up - So live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping 'til we're done
Live it up - So live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[GÃ¼nther:]
Make love, don't fight
Let's fuck tonight
Let's fuck tonight

[Pitbull:]
You name it, she's done it
She's the reason that women run it
Bet this on a Grammy
Maybe now you understand me

(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat)
(Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat)

[Jennifer Lopez:]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up - So live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain't stopping 'til we're done
Live it up - So live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[GÃ¼nther:]
Let's fuck tonight
Let's fuck tonight
