Guess who? J to the Lo
F to the AB
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

I ain't Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right Now (Oh)
I keep women in thongs coming along (Oh)
Invisibly set stones, some of them prone (Woo)
I can tell you ain't never had someone this long
One night, have them bumpin' my song like "mmm, mmm", girl
You ain't know I was coming this strong
Now you know not to come at me wrong
I get right, uh

[Jennifer Lopez:]
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping (Tripping) a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right (get right), we can get right (get right)
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right (get right), tonight (get right)
(We can get right)

Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh

Your lips talking 'bout I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving, oh, so slow (So slow)
Bar tab looking like a car note (Car note)
All I need is you here right by my side (Woo)
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride (Oh)
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right (get right), we can get right (get right)
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right (get right), tonight (get right)
(We can get right)

So much we've got to say, but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand, I'll show you why

[Fabolous:]
It's slim with the tilted rim on 20-inch rims
Rock up wrist watch, six-inch Timbs
Button-up shirt cuffed with the French trim
So you can tell a man get to the right (Oh)
I'm in the driver's seat, you sit to the right (Oh)
And this is just to get to the flight (Oh)
I like the way it fit to you tight
So I'ma show you the world in a day
'Fore it even get to the night
I'm lookin' for a dime, but I don't need a penny though
Any old wanna be Jenny-Lo, no
Plenty dough and there's plenty more where it come from
I'm the real talk where I come from, ho
