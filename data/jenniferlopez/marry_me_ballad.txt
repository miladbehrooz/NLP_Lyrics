
I've never seen forever
I've never seen forever in the wild
But now I'm looking, now I'm looking in its eyes
Baby, you're my shelter
Shelter from a broken paradise
I couldn't dream it any better if I tried

True love got a ring, ring, ring
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring
You the queen, I be the king, king, king
For life, for life, for life

Marry me, marry me, say yes
Marry me, marry me, say yes
Marry me, marry me, say yes
For the rest, the rest of your life

I'ma fly out to Vegas, yeah
We could tie it up tonight, no patience
Take my last name put it where your name is
Have they ever seen a love this famous?

They never, no, they never
This forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Ain't nobody do it better, better, better
And it's only getting better

True love got a ring, ring, ring (Ooh, we gotta)
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring (Ooh, they gotta)
This queen need a king, king, king
For life, for life, for life (For life)

True love got a ring, ring, ring (Ring, ring)
Church bells let 'em ring, ring, ring (Ring, ring)
Angels gonna sing, sing, sing
Tonight, tonight, tonight

Baby, marry me, marry me, say yes
Marry me, marry me, say yes
Marry me, marry me, say yes
For the rest, the rest of your life (Marry me, baby)

Marry me, marry me, say yes
Marry me, marry me, say yes
Marry me, marry me, say yes
For the rest, the rest of your life

Baby
Si me das tu mano, te lo juro por mi vida que serÃ© fiel
Y aunque pasen cosas buenas y cosas malas, yo siempre estarÃ©
CuidÃ¡ndote
Un amor eterno te darÃ©

Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-marry me
