
What? What? What? Hey
Yeah, you

You had a dark, sexy vibe about you
And in a strange way you turn me on
The way you look said a lot about you
As if you really didn't give a uh
I told myself not to fall for you
Because I can see that you don't follow rules
I should have just walked away
But your eyes were telling me to stay

Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on?

It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like

A real rebel kind of fellow
The kind that I would never trust
I could read what your mind was thinking
It's like you still didn't give a hey
It's funny how those kind of guys
Have a way of getting what they want
And even good girls, though they try
You see, they just can't seem to stay away

Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on?

It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
Oh, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Oh, baby, that's what it feels like

I can be your cherry pie
And you can be my cream on top, come on
I can be your cherry pie
And you can be my cream on top, yeah

It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
Oh, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Oh, baby, that's what it feels like
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it (Cherry pie)
Driving fast, you had to try it
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Yeah, yeah
