
Maybe, I need to see you
Oh, oh, oh
Please, come over

One, you come to my room for a little game
To you, I'll do very erotic things
I wanna make love, babe, very slowly
Three times in a row, all night I'll go

I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over

Body next to mine, love dance, syncopated time
Sugar rush keeps me high, sweet kiss on my thigh
I wanna make love, baby, very badly
Feels good in the air every time you're here

I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over

Don't keep me waiting, anticipating
Love, I am saving for you (Ooh)
Hear what I'm saying, you I am craving
Love is here waiting for you (Ooh)
All day you're staying, please no delaying (Oh)
Patiently waiting for you
Don't keep me waiting, no time for playing
Sitting here waiting for you

Come over
I love when you come over (Please come over)
Please come over (I need to see you)
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over (I need to see you)
I love when you come over (Make it so)
Please come over (I love when you come over, come on, baby, don't make me wait)
And when you come (I need you), it gives me fever
Come over (I can't wait anymore, oh)

I love when you come over (I love it)
And when you come, it gives me fever (It gives me fever, oh)
I love when you come over
And when you come, it gives me fever
