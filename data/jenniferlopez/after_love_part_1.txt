
Long nights in your car
Mornings in your arms
From five hour calls
To nothing at all
I guess I missed the signs
The writing on the wall
Don't know where it all went wrong

But if this is how it's got to be
I need someone to tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

What comes after love?
I wanna know there's somethin' for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there's a happy ever after love
Tell me there's a happy ever after us

I know you said that this was meant to be
Now those words are ancient history
At least I get to keep the memories
Mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Will somebody catch me when I fall?
Till then I'll keep on dancing on my own

But if this is how it's got to be
I need someone to tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me

What comes after love?
I wanna know there's somethin' for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there's a happy ever after love
Tell me there's a happy ever after us

I believe, I believe, I believe in love
Even if, even if it wasn't meant for us
I believe, I believe, I believe in love
I just need someone to tell me

What comes after love?
I wanna know there's somethin' for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there's a happy ever after love
Tell me there's a happy ever after us

What comes after love?
I wanna know there's somethin' for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there's a happyever after love
Tell me there's a happy ever after us
