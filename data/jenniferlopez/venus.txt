
She's got it
Yeah baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus
I'm your fire
Your desire

Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a silver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

She's got it
Yeah baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus
I'm your fire
Your desire
I'm your Venus
I'm your fire
Your desire

Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man go mad
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no-one else had
Wa!

She's got it
Yeah baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus
I'm your fire
Your desire
I'm your Venus
I'm your fire
Your desire

Oh
Uh, oh!

Venus
She's got it
Yeah baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus
I'm your fire
Your desire
I'm your Venus
I'm your fire
Your desire
