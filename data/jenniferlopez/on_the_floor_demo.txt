Ayy, oh-ayy-oh-ayy

Ayy, oh-ayy-oh-ayy

[Pitbull {Jennifer Lopez}:]
I'm loose, loose
And everybody knows I get off the chain
Babe, it's the truth, truth
I'm like Inception, I play with your brain
So I don't sleep or snooze, snooze
I don't play no games so d-d-don't-don't-don't get it confused, no
'Cause you will lose, yeah
Now, now pu-pu-pu-pu-pump it up
And back it up, like a Tonka truck
That badonkadonk is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy
Seven-trey donkey donk
All I need is some vodka and some chonky Coke
And watch, shit gon' get Donkey Konged (Hahaha)
Baby, if you're ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me, lale
Don't believe me, just bet me (Hahaha)
My name ain't Keith, but I see why you sweat me
{Straight to L.A. New York, Vegas to Africa}
L.A., Miami, New York
Say no more, get on the floor (Woo)

[Jennifer Lopez:]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor (Floor, floor)
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor

I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor (Hey)
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving, put your drinks up
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York, Vegas to Africa

Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor (Floor, floor)
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor

[Jennifer Lopez & Porcelain Black:]
Break it off, kick it up
Raise the roof, wreck the dancehall
Rip these walls, light it up
Make some noise, ohh

[Jennifer Lopez:]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor (Floor, floor)
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more (more)

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
