
You must be thinking, how did I get here?
And I wonder if you've been here before
So many things I want to ask you, and know about you
You seem like you are ready to run
Stand right up and walk out that door
Oh yes, you've been here before
But for this moment you're all mine
So let's just take it one step at a time

One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast

I would spend my lifetime wondering why
He chose me for you and you for I
You have things to teach me
I have a feeling inside
I have this vision of three of us
Holding hands
Through a valley and jumping towards the sky

But one step at a time
We will take it one step at a time

One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast

How can three become one?
You're the greatest thing that I've ever done
I wanna create a world
You will always want comeback to
And here's my wish for both of you

(Oh, come to this time)
(Oh, come to this place)
(Oh, come to this smile that precious love that's on your face)

I wish you all the peace that you can have forever
Because of as many things I've learned there's nothing better
A life filled with true love
And a friend I wish you can always rely
There'll be mommy
Hugs and kisses an endless supply
Told me to love and I will teach you to fly
So small and so delicate
It would be so easy to hurt you, I bet
But if I did I would die
Do you think I'll do alright?

One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast
