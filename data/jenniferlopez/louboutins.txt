
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh, ah, radio killer
Taking back my love (Taking back my love)
Taking back my love (Taking back my love)
Taking back my love (Taking back my love)
Taking back my love (Taking back my love)

You said you changed (You changed)
But still nothing (Nothing)
You're still the same (The same)
I'm just a part time lover (Lover)
And I'm the blame (The blame)
Shoulda went away (Away)
But yet, I stay (I stay)
With a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone, I'm alone
Now you got me stressin' out, on the phone
But this the last time, I'm movin' on

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state (The state)
Changed everything (Everything)
No more 8-1-8 (1-8)
For the part time lover (Lover)
What goes around
Comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover (Lover)

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone, I'm alone
Now you got me stressin' out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms and the back of my jeans (Watch me)
Watch me go, bye baby, don't know what you got until it's gone
Tail lights, it's all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch me walk it out, walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out, boy, watch me walk it out
Uh, walk it out, walk this right up out the house

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (Out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
