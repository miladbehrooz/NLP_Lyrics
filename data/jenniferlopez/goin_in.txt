[Flo Rida:]
Hey, put your palms on the ceiling
Nobody move, nobody get shot
Next rounds on me
I love a hot mami when she around on me
So I never get enough of yelling, ven aqui
Officer on duty, J.Lo what they call her
Take me to jail, 'cause I wanna be your robber
Put me in a cell if you really need to holler
Put me in a cell, feet down, Flo Rida, hey
To the sky, put your hands on rock
Plus nobody telling please that the club is mi casa
Shorty want a freak, I'm the one you call papa
Got to make them sing high notes like opera
When the ego, I got four leo
Even the DJ, wanna rep Puerto Rico
Got it on replay, like you just broke a needle
Whatever that he say, better listen up people

[Jennifer Lopez:]
Tonight, feels like
Tonight, feels like, the best night of my life
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, hey!
