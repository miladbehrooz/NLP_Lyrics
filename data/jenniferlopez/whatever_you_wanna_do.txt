
C'mon man, I need something that I can move to
You needa give me some of that funk

Yeah, uh, yeah, woo
Yeah, uh, whoa, uh
Uh, uh, whoa, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Whoa)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Whoa)

Pulled up at the red light
Cutie popped up on my left side
Window down, waiting for my reply
Not a word, I saw it in his eyes
Tell me something good, baby
He said, "Whatever you wanna do" (For real? Uh)

He pulled to the curb, houses flash by (Woo!)
I got out with the catwalk shy (Catwalk shy)
Short skirt, golden brown thighs
Gucci heels, four-inch high
He touched my face
Smiled and said, "Whatever you wanna do" (Catch ya)

Now I, I said I usually need some time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
Maybe we need tonight
Whatever you want

We sipping, music all loud
Conversation, your lollipop mouth
You open up, sweet things come out
Whisper to me, what you talking about?
I said, "I think you know"
He said, "Whatever you wanna do" (Woo!)

You stand up, taking my breath (Taking my breath)
It's your song so you do it two steps (Do it two steps)
I turned away, moved my hips slow (Move so slow)
Your thoughts, fully exposed
Now we better stop playing
I said, "Boy, what you gonna do?" (Hey)

Now I, oh I usually take my time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
You and I need tonight

Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)

Uh, uh, uh, so good
Look at you, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on
Yeah, yeah, woo
Whatever you want to do, yeah

Now I normally take my time to get inside
So I, I don't know why it feels so right
So maybe we need tonight
Baby, we need, hey, hey, yeah

Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want (Hey, hey)
Whatever you want
