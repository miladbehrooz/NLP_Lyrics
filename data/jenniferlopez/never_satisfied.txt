
I been tossing and turning
Oh this hunger is burning
I need something to feed my soul (oh-oh-oh)
I race my thoughts to the morning
I got this need that's growing
Wake you up just to make me whole (oh-oh-oh)

Your body is Heaven and it feels like home (oh-oh-oh)
And those sweet lips I can never let you go

I'm never satisfied
Honey my appetite
Is keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love
I need you all the time
You bring me back to life
I'm going crazy for more of your love

Craving hits every time I leave you
There ain't nothing else I can do
I'll follow anywhere you go (oh-oh-oh)

Your body is Heaven and it feels like home (oh-oh-oh)
And those sweet lips I can never let you go

I'm never satisfied
Honey my appetite
Is keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love
I need you all the time
You bring me back to life
I'm going crazy for more of your love

One taste is never enough I'm losing my mind
I can't stop thinking 'bout your sweet love all of the time
I don't know if I'm gonna make it alone
Make it alone

I'm never satisfied
Honey my appetite
Is keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love
I need you all the time (All the time)
You bring me back to life (Back to life)
I'm going crazy for more of your love
