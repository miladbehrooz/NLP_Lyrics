
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Let all the heat pour down
I'm good as long as he's around
He lets me wear the crown
I do my best to make him proud

Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Yeah)

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi (Oh, oh, oh)
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi (Oh, oh, oh)

My rock is shining bright
Even if he ain't by my side
He makes sure that I glow
I make sure everybody knows

Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Mo-move)

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi (Oh, oh, oh)
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi (Oh, oh, oh)
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)

Step up, step up, let your hair down
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out
If, if he rocks, tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi
Step up, step up, let your hair down (LlÃ©gale, llÃ©gale)
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out (SuÃ©ltate el pelo)
If, if he rocks, tear up the crowd (LevÃ¡ntate, cae y asegÃºralo)
Dance for your papi (Ve con todo)
Step up, step up, let your hair down (Si Ã©l es lo mÃ¡ximo, azota baldosa)
Pop, drop, and lock it, go all out
If, if he rocks, tear up the crowd
Dance for your papi (Baila para tu papi)

Now all my super ladies, I got my baby
If you got your baby, baby (Mo-move)

Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi (Oh, oh, oh)
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi (Oh, oh, oh)
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
Move your body, move your body
Dance for your papi (Oh, oh, oh)
Rock your body, rock your body
Dance for your papi (Oh, oh, oh)
Put your hands up in the air
Dance for your man if you care
Put your hands up in the air, air, air (Oh, oh, oh)
