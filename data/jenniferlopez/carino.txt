Like I want you, babe
Come and let me show you just how much I feel inside
I got so much love

Oh baby, when I get near you
Ooh, I can't control what I'm feeling, baby
I got so much love to give you
That I would probably want you all the time

CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Gotta have your love)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Need to feel your touch)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Never get enough)
CariÃ±o, cariÃ±o

I wish that I could spend all my days and nights
Wrapped in your arms spending time with you
Because all I see in this world is me and you and no one else
Ooh, I want you more and more

Oh baby, please understand me
I think that you deserve me, oh, yeah
Because I'm the type that would give you
All the love and affection that you need

CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Gotta have your love)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Need to feel your touch)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Never get enough)
CariÃ±o, cariÃ±o
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Gotta have your love)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Need to feel your touch)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Never get enough)
CariÃ±o, cariÃ±o

AsÃ­, un poquito mÃ¡s suavecito, ah
AjÃ¡, asÃ­ es que me gusta, huh
Â¡Ahora, ahora! Huh
Â¡Eso!

CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Gotta have your love)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Need to feel your touch)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Never get enough)
CariÃ±o, cariÃ±o

CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Gotta have your love)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
(Need to feel your touch)
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o

CariÃ±o, cariÃ±o

CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
CariÃ±o, quÃ©date conmigo, cariÃ±o
CariÃ±o, cariÃ±o
