
I am hooked on you
Yeah, I'm ready to go
I'm ready to dance
Are you? I wanna see it

Lights turn always like 90 degrees
Your standing on the wall, but baby, not me
Taking center stage, come on the floor
Rolling 'til I break doing this and more
Lights turn always like 90 degrees
Your standing on the wall, but baby, not me
Taking center stage, come on the floor
Rolling 'til I break, doing this and more

Do it to the floor boards shake
Do it 'til the windows break
The whole room vibrates
And it's like an earthquake
Do it to the floor boards shake
Do it 'til the windows break
The whole room vibrates
And it's like an earthquake

Just lace them shoes tight
And bring it down to the floor (That's right)
Under these lights (We working it hard)
I take him back to the hood

'Cause I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
On you, on you

I say it again like I said it before
I'm in the middle, took it to the floor
Shadows on the wall, steam is on my back
Sweat dripping hard, feel it drip, drip, drop
I say it again like I said it before
I'm in the middle, took it to the floor
Shadows on the wall, steam is on my back
Sweat dripping hard, feel it drip, drip, drop

Do it to the floor boards shake
Do it 'til the windows break
The whole room vibrates
And it's like an earthquake
Do it to the floor boards shake
Do it 'til the windows break
The whole room vibrates
And it's like an earthquake

Just lace them shoes tight
And bring it down to the floor (That's right)
Under these lights (We working it hard)
I take him back to the hood

'Cause I'm hooked I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
On you, on you

Just lace them shoes tight
And bring it down to the floor (That's right)
Under these lights (We working it hard)
I take him back to the hood

'Cause I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
On you, on you

Look right here, baby, don't stop now
Forget them people and forget the crowd
Loving in the club, no, not right now
Sweating until it hurt while the music's loud
Look right here, baby, don't stop now
Forget them people and forget the crowd
Loving in the club, no, not right now
Sweating until it hurt while the music's loud

Like that, like that
I like it like that
I like it like that
My neck and my back
Like that, like that
I like it like that
I like it like that
My neck and my back

Just lace them shoes tight
And bring it down to the floor (That's right)
Under these lights (We working it hard)
I take him back to the hood

'Cause I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
On you, on you (You, you)
