
The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me "honey"
But you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss, a whisper of love
I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity

This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew, but I was living in vain
She called my house
She said, "You know my name,
And don't you pretend you never did me before."
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me "honey"
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous.
The girl is so dangerous.
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind.
It's a passion in my soul,
But you're no damn lover friend of mine.

I cannot sleep alone at night.
My baby left me here tonight.
I cannot cope 'til it's all right.
You and your manipulation.
You hurt my baby.

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of a strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it 'cause it's dangerous

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me "honey"
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me "honey"
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me "honey"
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover friend of mine

My baby!
You ain't, you don't, no.
You don't, you don't, don't, oh, my baby!
