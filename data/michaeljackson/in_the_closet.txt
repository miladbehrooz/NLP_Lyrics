[Princess Stephanie of Monaco:]
There's something I have to say to you if you promise you'll understand.
I cannot contain myself when in your presence
I'm so humble.
Touch me, don't hide our love
Woman to man

[Michael:]
She's just a lover who's doin' me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it

She wants to give it
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)

It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste it
Then if you want it
Then won't you taste it

She wants to give it
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
Dare me
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)

[Princess Stephanie of Monaco:]
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust
Woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free

[Michael:]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby

Just promise me
Whatever we say or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just keep it in the closet

If you can get it
It's worth a try
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
[Princess Stephanie of Monaco:]
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it

[Michael:]
She wants to give it
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)

[Princess Stephanie of Monaco:]
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me
You'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell

[Michael:]
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want

Just promise me
Whatever we say or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just keep it in the closet

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
There is somethin' about you baby
That makes me want

Just promise me
Whatever we say or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just keep it in the closet

(she wants to give it)
Dare me
Keep it in the closet
(she wants to give it)
Dare me
Keep it in the closet

[Repeat 'til the end]
(she wants to give it)
(ah, she wants to give it)
