Marchinâ like the soldier, 
Marchinâ like a soldier boy, 
Show you the things that make a man a king, 
Marchinâ like the soldier,
Marchinâ like a soldier boy, 
Why donât you shine like youâre the man again

People say that youâre blind,
Then they say that youâre fine, 
But they wonât help you find, find the road again 
If they wonât help you fight

Then leave you delirious
Oh my

Marchinâ like the soldier, 
Marchinâ like a soldier boy, 
Show you the things that make a man a king, 
Marchinâ like the soldier,
Marchinâ like a soldier boy, 
Why donât you shine like youâre the man again

No, no
No, no
Baby, baby
Hee hee hee
No, no
Baby, baby
Hee hee hee

Marchinâ like the soldier, 
Marchinâ like a soldier boy, 
Show you the things that make a man a king, 
Marchinâ like the soldier,
Marchinâ like a soldier boy, 
Why donât you shine like youâre the man again

Marchinâ like the soldier, 
Marchinâ like a soldier boy, 
Show you the things that make a man a king, 
Marchinâ like the soldier,
Marchinâ like a soldier boy, 
Why donât you shine like youâre the man again
