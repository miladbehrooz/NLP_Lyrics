Are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them
The magic, the wonder, the mystery, and the innocence of a child's heart
Are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world
I really believe that

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?

When I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature
I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents
What we need to learn from children isn't childish
They know the way to summon things that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts

People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood (Childhood) I've never known

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

Have you seen my Childhood?
