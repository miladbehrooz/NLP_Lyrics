
As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, and got out, and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist, so
I walked down, towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend, I'll take care, take my hand, I'll take you there

Wooo!

Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to a place without no name (Without, no name)

As she took me right through the fog
I seen beautiful city appear
Of where kids are playing and people are laughing and smiling and nothing to fear
She said this is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down at my eyes, and they started crying, and grabbed my hand, you've got a friend

Hooo!

Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to a place without no name (A place without, place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (Take me, take me, place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (A place without)

Hooo!
Yeah!
Doggone!
Hooo!

She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds, and the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness, how in the world, could I wanna leave
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought, you could be in another world

Oooh!

Take me to a place without no name (Doggone, take me, no name)
Take me to a place without no name (See, a place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (Take me, doggone, place without no name)
Take me to a place without no name (See, a place without, no, no, no)

La la la lalala lalala la la (Na, na, a place without no name)
La la la lalala lalala la la (A place without no name)
La la la lalala lalala la la (Na, na, na, a place without no name)
La la la lalala lalala la la (See, a place without)
La la la lalala lalala la la (Take me, take me, take me, a place without no name)
La la la lalala lalala la la (A place without no name)
La la la lalala lalala la la (A place without no name)
La la la lalala lalala (A place without no name)
La la la lalala lalala la la (A place without no name)
