[Michael:]
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Paul:]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Paul:]
I love you more than he
(take you anywhere)

[Michael:]
But I love you endlessly
(loving we will share)

[Michael and Paul:]
So come and go with me
Two on the town

[Michael:]
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

[Paul:]
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time

[Michael:]
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Michael and Paul:]
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

[Paul:]
The girl is mine (mine, mine) yep she's mine (mine, mine)
The girl is mine (mine, mine) yep she's mine (mine, mine)

[Michael:]
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

[Paul:]
Michael, we're not gonna fight about this, okay?

[Michael:]
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter

[Paul:]
I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?

[Michael:]
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another

[Paul]
Is that what she said?

[Michael:]
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming

[Paul]
I don't believe it (mine, mine) no

[Michael and Paul:]
The girl is mine (mine, mine)
No, mine
No, mine (mine, mine)

[Paul:]
She's mine mine mine mine mine (mine, mine, mine)

[Michael:]
'Cause the girl is mine (mine, mine)

[Paul:]
No girl is mine (mine, mine)

[Fade-out/repeat]
