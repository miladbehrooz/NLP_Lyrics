
You know, youâyou make me feel so good inside
I always wanted a girl just like you
You're such a P.Y.T. pretty young thing

Where did you come from baby
And ooh won't you take me there?
Right away won't you baby
Tenderoni you've got to be
Spark my nature
Sugar fly with me

Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can make it right
Hit the city lights

Then tonight ease the love and pain
Let me take you to the max

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love, and care
And I'll take you there
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love, and care
And I'll take you there

Anywhere you wanna go (Yes, I will.)

Nothin' can stop this burnin'
Desire to be with you
Gotta get to you baby
Won't you come, it's emergency
Cool my fire yearnin'
Honey, come set me free

Don't you know now is the perfect time
We can dim the lights
Just to make it right

In the night hit the lovin' spot
I'll give you all that I've got

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love, and care
And I'll take you there (Yes, I will.)
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love, and care
And I'll take you there
Yes, I will

Pretty young thing
You make me say
Pretty young thing
You make me say

Pretty young things, repeat after me

[P.Y.T.'s] Na, na, na
[Michael] Na, na, na, na
[P.Y.T.'s] Na, na, na, na
[Michael] Say "Na, na, na."
[P.Y.T.'s] Na, na, na
[Michael] Na, na, na, na, na
[P.Y.T.'s] Na, na, na, na, na
[Michael] I'll take you there, take you there

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love, and care
And I'll take you there
Take you there
Take you there

I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Tender love, and care
And I'll take you there
Take you there

[Ad-lib and fade-out:]
I want to love you (P.Y.T.)
Pretty young thing
Oh, baby
You need some lovin' (T.L.C.)
Pretty young thing
Oh, darling
You know I think you are really, really nice
You and I could've, could've just put together
You're such a P.Y.T. Pretty young thing
I just wanna love you, you know, it's
I'd give you all
