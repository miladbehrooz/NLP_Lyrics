
Are you ready for a real good time
Are you ready for a real good treat
There'll be so much dancing, singing
I let you fall into me

[Chorus:]
So donât be messinâ around, donât be messin around
Donât be messinâ around hey hey hey
Donât be messinâ around, donât be messinâ around
Donât be messinâ around hey

If I started now in the deep
Think you said this feeling is your life
Iâll be so proud if you let me love ya girl
Let me love ya for a little while

[Chorus:]
Donât be messinâ around, donât be messin around
Donât be messinâ around hey hey hey
So donât be messinâ around, donât be messinâ around
Donât be messinâ around hey
Oho yeah yeah,
Oho yeah, oho yeah, oho yeah

Now she started finger popping to the beat
So I said lets get right on the floor
She said to keep your mind on dancing
Won't be no romancing
No no don't mess around with me
I ain't playing

[Chorus:]
Donât be messinâ around, donât be messin around
Donât be messinâ around hey hey hey
So donât be messinâ around, donât be messinâ around
Donât be messinâ around hey hey

[Chorus x2]
