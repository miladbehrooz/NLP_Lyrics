
You laughed at me, you made me cry
You made a joke, then wonder why
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)

I say "Hello", you say "Goodbye"
I reach to you, you don't even try
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)

If losing you makes me happy
Then why does it make me cry
If losing you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die

I'm born to lose, you know it's true
And here I stand, I'm losing you
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)

You were the one to let me know
You needed me, now I have to go
(I am a loser)
Alright
(I am a loser)

If losing you makes you happy
Then why does it make me cry
Losing you makes me a winner
Then how did our love ever die
Ever die

I am a fool, you know it's true
I believed in you, now you don't even try
(I am a loser)
Alright
(I am a loser)

What foolish kind of guy am I
You break my heart, I wonder why
(I am a loser)
Alright
(I am a loser)
Alright
(I am a loser)
Babe
(I am a loser)
Alright
(I am a loser)
Baby
(I am a loser)
Alright
(I am a loser)
(I am a loser)
Alright, alright
(I am a loser)
One time, alright
(I am a loser)
Let me win one time, alright
(I am a loser)
I gotta win, I gotta win, I can't lose
(I am a loser)
Don't talk about this one time, please
On my begging knees, on my begging knees
(I am a loser)
Ooh, alright
(I am a loser)
hee hee
I am a loser, baby
I am a loser, baby
I am a loser, uh
I am a loser
I am a loser
I am a loser, baby
I am a loser, baby
I am a loser
(I am a loser)
Let me win one time, let me win one time
(I am a loser)
Alright
(I am a loser)
Hee
(I am a loser)
Goodbye to you, goodbye to me, goodbye to you
(I am a loser)
Hello world
Maybe tomorrow
(I am a loser)
Maybe today
Who knows who will win
(I am a loser)
