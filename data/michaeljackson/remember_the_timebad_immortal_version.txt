
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time?
('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

(Remember the time)
Ooh!
(Remember the time)
Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time)
On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
'Til dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time)
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
(Remember the time)
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat
(Remember the time)
Ooh! In the park
(Remember the time)
After dark, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you, did you?
(Remember the time)
Yeah, yeah, woo!
(Remember the time, remember the time
Remember the time, remember the time
Remember the time, remember the time
Remember the time, remember the time)

Who's bad?

The word is out, you're doing wrong
Gonna lock you up before too long
Your lying eyes gonna tell you right
So listen up, don't make a fight
Your talk is cheap, you're not a man
You're throwing stones to hide your hands

Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait 'til I get through

Because I'm bad, I'm bad (Shamone, really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it, you know (Really, really bad)
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?

Remember the time
Remember the time

If you don't like what saying, then won't you slap my face

Because I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know
Hoo, hoo, hoo
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, shamone, ah
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know it
You know, you know, you know, come on
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm, ooh, I'm bad, you know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, baby (Really, really bad)
You know, you know, you know it, shamone
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, you know, ooh (Really, really bad)
You know I'm bad, I'm bad, you know it, you know
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?
