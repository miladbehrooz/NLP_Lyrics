Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really wanna get me

Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
You really wanna fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really wanna get me
You really wanna get me

He really thought he really had
Had a hold of me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me

He really thought he really had
Had a hold of me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me

This time around I'm not going to get bit
Though you really wanna get me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really wanna fix me

Somebody's out, somebody's out to use me
You really want to use me
And then falsely accuse me
This time around don't treat me like spit
Though you really can't control me
You really can't control me

He really thought he really had
Had a hold of me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me

He really thought he really had
Had a hold of me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me

He really thought he really had
Had a hold of me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me

He really thought he really had
Had a hold of me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
Listen, I've got problems of my own
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin'
Maybe it could be my friends
They ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun totin'

If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm 'a kill a nigga I ain't jokin'
Indo smoke got me choking
I'm hopin' a fool come slippin'
So I could blow 'em open

This time around
I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rotts
Got pits by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers
So I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that, baby

[Michael]
This time around yeah

He really thought he really had
Had a hold of me

They thought they really had control of me

[Ad-libs in the background:]
Get me
Infect me
You really got go get me
Use me
Accuse me
Everybody's got to ... me
Take me
Change me
Everybody's gonna break me

This time around
He really thought
