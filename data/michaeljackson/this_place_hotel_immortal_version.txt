
Hee!

Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning
I promised I would never, ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
Hee! Hee!
As we walked into the room
There were faces staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said, "Welcome to your doom"
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

Someone stop my heart (Heartbreak hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak hotel)
Ten years ago today (Heartbreak hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak hotel)

We came to this place where the vicious dwell
Found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through

OW!
(Annie, are you okay?)
(Are you okay, Annie?)
