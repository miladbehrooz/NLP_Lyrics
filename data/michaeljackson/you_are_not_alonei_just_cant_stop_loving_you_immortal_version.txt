[Michael Jackson:]
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be you're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold

Every day I sit and ask myself: how did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone... lone lone why lone

Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

[Siedah Garrett:]
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

[Michael Jackson:]
I just can't hold on

[Siedah Garrett:]
I feel we belong

[Michael Jackson:]
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Both:]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

[Siedah Garrett:]
I just can't stop loving you

[Michael Jackson:]
Noche de estrellas
Haz que me quiera
Como a ella yo

[Siedah Garrett:]
De madrugada
Ven que te espera
Todo mi amor

[Michael Jackson:]
Soy joven, lo sÃ©
Pero siento que
Te quiero y solo vivo por ti

[Siedah Garrett:]
Me conoces bien

[Michael Jackson:]
Y sabes tambiÃ©n
Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tu amor

Todo mi amor eres tÃº (Ooh)
Todo mi amor eres tÃº
Cuando no estÃ¡s
No hay quien me dÃ©
Lo que das tÃº

[Michael Jackson:]
I just can't stop loving you

[Siedah Garrett:]
We can change all the world tomorrow

[Michael Jackson:]
We can sing songs of yesterday

[Siedah Garrett:]
I can say, hey... farewell to sorrow

[Michael Jackson:]
This is my life and I

[Both:]
Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you

[Siedah Garrett:]
No, baby

[Michael Jackson:]
Oh!

[Juntos:]
Pues todo mi amor lo eres tÃº

[Both:]
And if I stop...

[Michael Jackson:]
Oh!

[Both:]
Then tell me just what will I do

[Michael Jackson:]
What will I do? Uh... ooh...

[Both:]
I just can't stop loving you

[Michael Jackson:]
Hee! Hee! Hee! Know I do, girl

[Juntos:]
Pues todo mi amor lo eres tÃº

[Michael Jackson:]
You know I do

[Both:]
And if I stop...
Then tell me, just what will I do

[Michael Jackson:]
I just can't stop loving you

[Outro:]
Remember the Time
Remember the Time
Remember the Time
Remember the Time
