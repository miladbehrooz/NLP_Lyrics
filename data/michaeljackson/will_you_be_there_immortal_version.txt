
Think about the generations and to say we want to make it a better
World for our children and our children's children. So that they know
It's a better world for them; and think if they can make it a better place

Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?

Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused will you show to me
You'll be there for me
And care enough to bear me

(Hold me) Show me
(Lay your head lowly) Lowly
(Softly then boldly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human
(Hold me)
(Love me and feed me) Yeah yeah yeah
(Kiss me and free me) Yeah
(I will feel blessed) I'm only human
(Carry) Carry
(Carry me boldly) Carry me, yeah
(Lift me up slowly) Yeah
(Carry me there) I'm only human
(Save me)
(Heal me and bathe me) Lift me up, lift me up
(Softly you say to me)
(I will be there) I will be there
(Lift me)
(Lift me up slowly)
(Carry me boldly) Yeah
(Show me you care) Show me you care
(Hold me) Woo!
(Lay your head lowly) Get lonely sometime
(Softly then boldly)
(Carry me there) Carry me there
(Need me) Hoo!
(Love me and feed me) Lift me up, hold me
(Kiss me and free me) Lift me up sometime
(I will feel blessed)

In our darkest hour
In my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence
In my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pains
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart
