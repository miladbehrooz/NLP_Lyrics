Xscape, Xscape, Xscape

Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I got to get away so I can free my mind
Xscape, is what I need
From the electric eyes

No matter where I am I see my face around
They been lied on my name
Then put them town to town
Don't have a place to run but there's no need to hide
I got to find a place, but I won't hide away

Xscape, got to get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationship has to go away
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
Xscape, I do what I wanna 'cause I gotta please nobody but me
Xscape

I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change

Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you, I can do what I want to

Xscape, I got toâgotta get away from the system rules in the world today
I gotta get away
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationship has to go away
Don't get so naive
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
I gotta get away
Xscape, I do what I want 'cause I gotta face nobody but me
There's no way

Xscape, got to get away from the system rules in the world today
Don't get try it
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationship has to go away
Pressure that I'm facing every day
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
Come on now
Xscape, I do what I want 'cause I gotta face nobody but me
Come on now
Xscape

Where did I go
This problem world won't bother me
This problem world won't worry me no more

Xscape, got to get away from the system rules in the world today
I will fly away
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationship has to go away
Pressure that I'm facing 
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
Writes a lot of lies
Xscape, I do what I want 'cause I gotta face nobody but me
Xscape ain't good. I'll do just what I wanna

Xscape, I got to get away from the system rules in the world today
Don't wait
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationship has to go away
I got to get away
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that has no end
The man with the pen
Xscape, I do what I want 'cause I gotta face nobody but me
Do you want? I gotta be my 

Xscape, got to get away (I gotta get away)
I gotta be my 
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
(Take it no more!)
Xscape, the man with the pen
I can't take this garbage here no more
Xscape, I do what I want 'cause I gotta face nobody but me
'Cause you're a liar

Xscape, Xscape
