
She's got the look, she's so fine
And you know damn well the girl will be mine

She's got the breaks, she's the scene
And you know damn well she gives it to me

Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater
I know the girl is fakin'
'Cause I've seen her look better

She's composition, she's statistical fact
Got it ready for the willing
Got it kicking in the back

She's got the look
She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Come to the place, shock to see
And you know damn well you know what I mean

Hot in the face, one to three
Like a pleasure trip, like you've never seen

Satin lace and a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
And she knows she looks hot

She's got position
She's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case

She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Please, no, keep back, I can't take it
You're drivin' me wild
I might not make it
You got me lookin' like buckwheat, oh
Hair pulled every which way but me
Far from Medusa, but your looks are deadly
You walk is soft, still I hear the medley
Uh, shiver my Timberland boots, cramp my style
She drives me wild

She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look

She's got the look
She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

[Repeat with ad-libs until the end:]
She's got the look
I wanna know her better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
