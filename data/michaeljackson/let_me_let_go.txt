
Yea yea yea!
Oooh girl.
I remember you callin, sayin
That things were through with us.
I have a hard time feelin within.
Just started moving on.
Got back my feeling chilling.
Started chilling getting back with it.

Now I seem to be every where lately
Too much to be coincidentally
Why you wanna lead me on,
Iâm not the one you want
So girl donât keep me hangin
You wonât let me let go
Got me thinking itâs on
Girl you know that youâre wrong
You wonât, you wonât let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye donât mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You wonât! You wonât let me let go

Oooh yea
When we started datinâ makin
Moves on the single scene
Never seen you so jealous
Tellin all the other girls that youâre still with me
You may think its funny hunnie
I ainât laughin
You know what I think about it

Now I seem to be every where lately
To much to be coincidentally,
Why you wanna lead me on,
Iâm not the one you want
So girl donât keep me hangin
You wonât let me let go
Got me thinking itâs on
Girl you know that youâre wrong
You wont, you wonât let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye donât mean hello
Love you leave me alone
You wonât! You wonât let me let go
You wonât let me let go,
You wonât let me let go,
You wonât let me let go

You wonât let me let go
Got me thinking itâs on
Girl you know that youâre wrong
You wont, you wonât let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye donât mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You wonât! You wonât let me let go

You wonât let me let go
Got me thinking itâs on
Girl you know that youâre wrong
You wont, you wonât let me let go
