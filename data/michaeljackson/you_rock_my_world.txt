
My life will never be the same
'Cause, girl, you came and changed
The way I walk, the way I talk

I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But, girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you need

It feels so right (Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life
(All my life)
It feels like I (Like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine
(See, and I finally found, come on, girl)

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
(You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
(You rocked my world)

You rocked my world, you know you did
(Girl)
And everything I own I give
(I want you, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently

Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

Who'd think that I
Have finally found the perfect love
I searched for all my life
(Searched for all my life)
Who'd think I'd find
Such a perfect love
That's awesomely so right
(Whoa, girl)

You rocked my world, you know you did
(Come on, come on, come on, come on)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
(Girl)
Someone like you to call mine

You rocked my world, you know you did
(You rocked my world),
And everything I own I give
(Girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

And, girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here
