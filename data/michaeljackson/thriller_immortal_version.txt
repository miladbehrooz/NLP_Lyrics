[Michael Jackson:]
Ooh, uh, it's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, OW!

I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Vincent Price (Michael Jackson):]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe, ooh)
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

[Michael Jackson:]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, OW!
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

Ahahahahahahahaha
Ahahahahahahahaha!
