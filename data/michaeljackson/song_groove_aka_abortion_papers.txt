
Sister donât read, sheâll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian soul
What do we get, she runs away
What about love?
What about all I pray

Donât know the worst, she knows a atheist
What about God?
Living is all I see
What do you get, things she would say
What about love?
Thatâs all I pray

Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, Iâd like to have my child

Sister confused, she went alone
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding a life, reading the words
Singing a song, citing a Bible verse

Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse
What about all I've seen?
You know the lie, you keep it low
What about heart?
Thatâs all Iâve known

Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, Iâd like to have my child

Those abortion papers (Hoo!)
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, Iâd like to have my child

Look at my words, what do they say?
Look at my heart, burning is all heartbreak

What do you get?
What do you say?
What about love?
Feel my sin

Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, Iâd like to have my child

Those abortion papers (Hoo!)
Think about life, Iâd like to have my child

Who have the grateful?
Where will she go?
What will she do to see the world?

Sister donât know, where would she go
What about life?
What about all I saw?
What would you do?
Donât get so confused
Love all the things
Itâs just the things I do

Those abortion papers
Signed in your name against the words of God
Those abortion papers
Think about life, Iâd like to have my child
