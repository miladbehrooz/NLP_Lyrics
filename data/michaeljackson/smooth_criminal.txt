Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK,?
Are you OK, Annie?

Annie, are you OK?
Will you tell us that you're OK
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
You've been hit byâ
You've been hit by a smooth criminal

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats intimidations

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?

Then he struck you a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you OK?
Are you OK, Annie?
You've been hit byâ
You've been struck by a smooth criminal

OK, I want everybody to clear the area right now!

Annie, are you OK?
I don't know!
Will you tell us, that you're OK
I don't know!
There's a sound at the window
I don't know!
That he struck you a crescendo, Annie
I don't know!

He came into your apartment
I don't know!
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
I don't know why baby!
And then you ran into the bedroom
I don't know!
You were struck down
It was your doom, Annie!

Annie, are you OK?
Dang gone it, baby!
Will you tell us, that you're OK
Dang gone it, baby!
There's a sound at the window
Dang gone it, baby!
That he struck you a crescendo, Annie

He came into your apartment
Dang gone it!
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
Dang gone it!
You were struck down
It was your doom, Annie!
