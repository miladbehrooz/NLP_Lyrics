(Jam)
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam
It ain't too hard for me to jam

[Michael Jackson:]
Nation to nation
All the world must come together
Face the problems that we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor
She said later
What has come of all the people
Have we lost love of what it's about

I have to find my peace
'Cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother there'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day like it's the last

Go with it, go with it, HOO!

[Heavy D:]
Jam, jam
Here comes the man, hot damn
The big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed
Mingle mingle jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door 3's and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan first I cooled like a fan
Got with Janet then with Guy now with Michael
'Cause it ain't hard to...

[Michael Jackson:]
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
Daggonit, it ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't stop
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't, don't you
It ain't too much for me to

Jam
