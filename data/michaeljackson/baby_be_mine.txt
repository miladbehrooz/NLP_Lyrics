
I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side
Every moment takes me to paradise
Darlin' let me hold you
Warm you in my arms and melt your fears away
Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
I need you night and day

So baby be mine (baby you gotta be mine)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby be my girl (all the time)
And we can share this ecstasy
As long as we believe in love

I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I guess it's still you thrill me baby be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burning in my heart today
It's never gonna fade

So baby be mine (baby you gotta be mine)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby be my girl (all the time)
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live

Won't you stay with me until the mornin' sun
I promise you now that the dawn will be different
Lady can't you see that heaven's just begun
It's livin' here inside our hearts

There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still you thrill me baby be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time
Girl you got to hold me
We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
Hold me only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say

So baby be mine (baby you gotta be mine)
(tell me that you love me)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
(say you're thinking of me)
So baby be mine (all the time)
(show me how it should be)
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live
(every night it feels alright)

Baby be my girl
(tell me that you love me)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
(say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine, baby, be mine
(show me how it should be)
You're everything this world could be to me
(every night it feels alright)

C'mon girl c'mon girl
(tell me that you love me)
(say you're thinking of me)
So baby be mine
(show me how it should be)
You're everything this world could be to me
(every night it feels alright)
