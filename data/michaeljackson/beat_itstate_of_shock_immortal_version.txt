Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it...

Stop!
You wanna see who's bad? You wanna see who's bad?
Come on, come on, let's do it
Let's see who's bad, man, come on
Come on, let's go!

Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad?

They're tellin' me (They're tellin' me)
You're doin' wrong (You're doin' wrong)
They'll lock you up (They'll lock you up)
Before too long (Before too long)
You're doin' wrong (You're doin' wrong)
You're doin' wrong (You're doin' wrong)
You're doin' wrong, boy (You're doin' wrong)
You're doin' wrong (You're doin' wrong)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad, brother? (Who's bad?)
Who's bad? (Who's bad?)
Woo!

Beat it

Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
