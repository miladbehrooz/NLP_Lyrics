
Uh, huh, alright.

This time,
Gonna do my best to make it right.
Can't go on without you by my side.
Hold on.

Shelter,
Come and rescue me out of this storm.
And out of this cold I need someone.
Oh, why? Oh, why? Why? Why?

If you see her, tell her this from me.
All I need is

One more chance at love.
One more chance at love.
One more.
One more chance at love.
One more chance at love.
See. One more.

One more chance at love.
One more chance at love.

Searching 
For that one who is gonna make me whole.
Help me make these mysteries unfold.
Hold on.

Lightning
About to strike in rain only on me.
Hurt so bad sometimes it's hard to breathe.
Oh, why? Why?

If you see her, tell her this from me.
All I need is

One more chance at love.
One more chance at love.

One more chance at love.
One more chance at love.
One more chance for love.

One more chance at love.
One more chance at love.

One more chance at love.
One more chance at love.

And I would walk around this world to find her.
And I don't care what it takes. No.
Why?
I'd sail the seven seas to be near her.
And if you happen to see her,
See, tell her this from me
