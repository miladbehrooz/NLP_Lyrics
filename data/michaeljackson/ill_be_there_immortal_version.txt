
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there

If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there

Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there, I'll be there
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there
Just call my name, I'll be there
