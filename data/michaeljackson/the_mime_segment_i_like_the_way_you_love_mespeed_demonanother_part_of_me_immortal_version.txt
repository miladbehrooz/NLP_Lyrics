
I love to write songs, it's one of my favorite things to do
It's very spiritual, it's a connection
I'm just the source through which it comes
I'm inspired by a lot of things that is done from the Heavens
I listen to the music and I just create from there
This is the tempo... and this is the melody...
(1, 2, 3, 4)

We're takin' over
We have the truth
This is our mission
To see it through
Don't point your finger...
Not dangerous
This is our planet
You're one of us

We're sendin' out a major love
And this is our message to you
(Message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line waitin' for you
Can't you see...
You're just another part of me
Hee hee, ooh
Doo doo doo doo
OH! OH!
