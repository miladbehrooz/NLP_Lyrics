All the world
Must come together
Face the problems
That we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor
For a favor
She said later
What has come of
All the people
Have we lost love
Of what it's about

I have to find my peace cuz
No one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother
There'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day
Like it's the last

Go with it
Go with it

It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to

The world keeps changing
Rearranging minds
And thoughts
Predictions fly of doom
The baby boom
Has come of age
We'll work it out

I told my brothers
Don't you ask me
For no favors
I'm conditioned by
The system
Don't you talk to me
Don't scream and shout

She pray to god, to Buddha
Then she sings a
Talmud song
Confusions contradict
The self
Do we know right
From wrong
I just want you to
Recognize me
In the temple
You can't hurt me
I found peace
Within myself

Go with it
Go with it
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't
Don't you
It ain't too much for me to

Jam jam
Here comes the man
Hot damn
The big boy stands
Movin' up a hand
Makin' funky tracks
With my man
Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal
That's the man
Mike's so relaxed
Mingle mingle jingle
In the jungle
Bum rushed the door
3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan
First I cooled like a fan
Got with Janet
Then with guy
Now with Michael
Cause it ain't hard to

[Michael]
