
Cause this time of ours is borrowed
We must give a helping hand
Whatever happen to our heroes
They must get another chance
(We can do it again)

We drove close, closer and closer
And even though weâre almost there

You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine Iâm taking you away
Tonight

Come together all the people (we can do it now)
Hereâs your chance to make it right (go, take a chance)
And even though weâre gettinâ close
Weâre not there just yet
And even though weâre almost there

You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine Iâm taking you away
Then one more time close your eyes
Iâm always here to stay
(oh)
Tonight

(Iâm always here)
(Oh I)
(Iâm always here)
We can do it again
(Iâm always here)
