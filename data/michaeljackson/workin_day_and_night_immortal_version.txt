No, no, no

Ooh, my honey
You got me workin' day and night
Ooh, my sugar
You got me workin' day and night
Scratch my shoulder
It's aching, make it feel alright
When this is over
Lovin' you will be so right

(That's why)
You got me workin' day and night
And I'll be workin'
From sun up to midnight

You got me workin' workin' day and night
You got me workin' workin' day and night
You got me workin' workin' day and night
You got me workin' workin' day and night

How can you live girl
'Cause love for us was meant to be (well, ah)
Then you must be seein'
Some other guy instead of me (ooh)

(That's why)
You got me workin' day and night
And I'll be workin'
From sun up to midnight

You got me workin' workin' day and night (Hold on)
You got me workin' workin' day and night
(I'm so tired tired now)
You got me workin' workin' day and night (Hold on)
You got me workin' workin' day and night
(Hoo, hoo, hoo)

You got me workin' day and night (I don't understand it)
And I'll be workin'
From sun up to midnight

You got me workin' workin' day and night
(Yeah)
You got me workin' workin' day and night
(I'm so tired tired now)
You got me workin' workin' day and night
You got me workin' workin' day and night
(Take it over)
You got me workin' workin' day and night
(Aoow)
