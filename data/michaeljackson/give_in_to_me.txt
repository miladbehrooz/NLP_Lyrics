
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime
Looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the
Things I say

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me

You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me
Give in to me

You and your friends
Were laughing at me in town
But it's okay
And it's okay
You wont be laughing girl
When I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I'll, I'll not find
Gotta, some peace of my no

Don't try to tell me
Because your words
Just aren't enough

Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Talk to me woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me

Love is a feeling
I don't wanna hear it
Quench my desire
Takin' me higher
Tell it to the preacher
Satisfy the feeling
Give in to me
Give in to me

I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't wanna
Hear it
Give it to the fire
Talk to me woman
Quench my desire
I don't like a lady
Talk to me baby
Give in to me

Give in to the fire
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me

Love is a woman
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me
Give in to me

'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me woman
Quench my desire
Give it to the feeling
