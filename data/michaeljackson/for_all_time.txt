
Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything

And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch, you know so well
Somebody once said, "It's the soul that matters."
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well

And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time

Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there

And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time

Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say

And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time

Say that you'll never go
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time

Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time

... in low light
That's for all time
People make loving
That's for all time

Say that you'll never go
That's for all time
Baby, you never know
That's for all time
