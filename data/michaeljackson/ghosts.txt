
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs

And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

I don't understand it
I don't understand it!

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there

There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul has fallen

I don't understand it
Don't understand it

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?

They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there

There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul has fallen

Don't understand it!
Don't understand it!
You're just a dog gone!

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
Who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me?

And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?

They put a knife in my back,
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy

And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion to see me?

And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?

They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

Dog gone
But it's try to find peace of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
