
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel

But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away
And nothing is for real

When I'm with you I am lost for words
I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel
So silently I pray

Helpless and hopeless
That's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible
If God is on my side

When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away
And nothing is for real

I'll go anywhere
And do anything
Just to touch your face
There's no mountain high
I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words
And nothing is for real

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words
And nothing is for real

Speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
(You're always on my mind)
Though I'm with you I am lost for words
And nothing is for real
Speechless

Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words likeâlike "I love you"
