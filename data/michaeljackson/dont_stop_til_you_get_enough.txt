You know, I wasâ
I was wonderingâyou knowâif you could keep on,
Because the forceâitâit's got a lot of power
And it make me feel likeâahâitâit make me feel like "Oh!"

Lovely is the feelin' now
Fever, temperature's risin' now
Power (ah power) is the force the vow
That makes it happen
It asks no questions why
So get closer (closer now) to my body now
Just love me 'til you don't know how

Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain't nothin' like a love desire
I'm melting (I'm melting) like hot candle wax
Sensation (ah sensation) lovely where we're at
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining
'Cause this is love power

Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

(Oh baby, keep on...keep on)

Heartbreak enemy despise
Eternal (ah eternal) love shines in my eyes
So let love (oh let love) take us through the hours
I won't be complaining (no no)
'Cause your love is alright, alright

Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
