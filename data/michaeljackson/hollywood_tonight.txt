
Lipstick in hand.
Tahitian tan.
In her painted-on jeans.

She dreams of fame.
She changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen.
She's headed for the big time that means

She's going Hollywood.
She's going Hollywood tonight.
She's going Hollywood.
She's going Hollywood tonight.
She's going Hollywood.
She's going Hollywood tonight.

It's true that you may never ever have that chance again.
That chance again, baby.

West-bound Greyhound
To tinsel town
To pursue her movie-star dreams.
She's giving hot tricks to men
Just to get in.
She was taught that that's not clean.
She's headed for the big time that means

She's going Hollywood.
She's going Hollywood tonight.
She's going Hollywood.
She's going Hollywood tonight.
She's going Hollywood.
She's going Hollywood tonight.

It's true that you may never ever have that chance again.
That chance again, baby.

She gave up her life to follow her dreams.
Left behind everything for the movie scene.
Nothing more she could want. She was determined to follow her plan.
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad.
Now that she got her dream, she became a star.
It all looked so good, but only good from afar.
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera. Every guy wished they could.
Now it's back to reality for Ms. Hollywood.
