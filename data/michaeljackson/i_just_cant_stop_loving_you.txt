[Michael:]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say
I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

[Siedah:]
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call I hear harps,
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

[Michael:]
I just can't hold on

[Siedah:]
I feel we belong

[Michael:]
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Both:]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

[Siedah:]
'Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Michael:]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

[Siedah:]
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you

[Michael:]
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying,
"I do."

[Siedah:]
"I do."
This thing can't go wrong

[Michael:]
This feeling's so strong

[Siedah:]
Well, my life ain't worth living

[Both:]
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

[Michael:]
I just can't stop loving you

[Siedah:]
We can change all the world tomorrow

[Michael:]
We can sing songs of yesterday

[Siedah:]
I can say, hey farewell to sorrow

[Michael:]
This is my life and I

[Both:]
Want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you

[Siedah:]
No, baby

[Both:]
I just can't stop loving you

[Siedah:]
If I can't stop!

[Both:]
And if I stop

[Siedah:]
No

[Siedah:]
Then tell me just what will I do
What will I do?

[Both:]
I just can't stop loving you

[Michael:]
Know I do girl!

[Both:]
I just can't stop loving you

[Michael:]
You know I do
And if I stop

[Both:]
Then tell me just what will I do

[Both:]
I just can't stop loving you
