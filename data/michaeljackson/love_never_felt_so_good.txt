And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh, baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, got to be
I can't take it

'Cause, baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life, in out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life, in out, baby
So, baby, yes, love never felt so good

Baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it

'Cause, baby, every time I love you
It's in and out my life, in out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life driving me crazy
Baby, love never felt so good

Aw, baby, love never felt so fine
And I doubt if you're mine all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Aw, baby, love never felt so good (so good)
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it

'Cause, baby, every time I love you
It's in and out my life, in out, baby
Tell me, if you really love me
It's in and out my life driving me crazy
'Cause, baby, love never felt so good

Felt so good
Never felt so good
Felt so good
Never felt so good
Never felt so good
Never felt so good
Never felt so good

Alright that's fine, that's it
