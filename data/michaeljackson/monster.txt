
You can look at them coming out the walls
You can look at them climbing out the bushes
You can find them when the letterâs bout to fall
He be waiting with his camera right on focus

Everywhere you seem to turn
thereâs a monster
When you look up in the air thereâs a monster
Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster
(Too bad)

Oh oh Hollywood itâs got you jumping like you should
(Too bad)
Itâs got you bouncing off the wall
Itâs got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror
And tell me you like
Donât you, donât you like it

Monster
Heâs a monster
Heâs an animal

Monster (yea-eah)
Heâs a monster
Heâs an animal

Heâs coming at ya
Coming at ya rather too fast
Mama say mama got you in a zig zag
And youâre running
And youâre running just to escape it
But they are gunning for the money
So they fake it

Everywhere you seem to turn
thereâs a monster
When you look up in the air thereâs a monster
When you see them in the street
thatâs a monster, monster, monster
(Too bad)

Oh oh Hollywood itâs got you jumping like you should
Itâs got you bouncing off the wall
Itâs got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood just look in the mirror
And tell me you like what you see

Monster
(heâs like an animal)
Heâs a monster
(just like an animal)
Heâs an animal
(and heâs moving in the air)
Monster
Heâs a monster
Heâs an animal
(everybody wanna be a star)

Why are they never satisfied with all you give, yeh, yeh, yeh, yeah
You give them your all
Theyâre watching you fall
And they eat your soul like a vegetable

[50 Cent]
Catch me in a bad mood, flippinâ youâll take a whippinâ
animal, hannibal, cannibal addition
tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision
fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippinâ
shiver a second, now, now, now, now what is it
funeralâs, cemetaries, donât worry itâs time to visit
broke bones, tombstones, how do you think Iâm kidding
its home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden
all hell, run tell, the King has risen
2010 Thriller, thereâs nothing iller, itâs killer
there vision, the missinâ the pack, this is that,
this the bomb, ring the alarm
MJ number 1, itâs goes on and on
its goes on and on
we get to crippinâ, its running in the early mornâ
keep on dreaming thereâs nowhere to run
you can drive but you done
I can feel it in the air, here the monster come.

[Michael Jackson]
Too bad, oh oh Hollywood itâs got you jumping like you should
Itâs got you bouncing off the wall
Itâs got you drunk enough to fall
(Too bad)
Oh oh Hollywood just making it clearer
And tell me you like
Donât you donât you like it

Monster
(she wanna be a star)
Heâs a monster
(say you wanna go far)
Heâs an animal
(Why do you keep stalking me)
Monster
(what you do to me)
Heâs a monster
(why did you take, why did you fake it)
Heâs an animal
(yee-aah, why are stalking me)

Monster
(why are you haunting me)
Heâs a monster
(why are you stalking me)
Heâs an animal
(why did you do it, why did you, why are you stalking me)

Monster
(why are you haunting me)
Heâs a monster
(why are you haunting me)
Heâs an animal
(Why did you, why did you)

Heâs dragging you down like a monster
heâs keeping you down like a monster

Heâs dragging you down like a monster
Heâs keeping you down like a monster
