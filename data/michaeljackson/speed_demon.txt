
I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothin' really matters
I've got to be on time

Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks
Is he getting nearer
I feel some heat is on my back

(speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a leadway
(speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway
Gotta have it my way
(speed demon)
Mind is like a compass
I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(speed demon)
(he say) pull over boy and get your ticket right

And nothin' gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speedin' on the midway
I gotta really burn this road

(speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get the leadway
(speed demon)
Doin' it on the highway
Gotta have it my way
(speed demon)
Mind is like a compass
I'm stoppin' at nothin'
(speed demon)
(he say) pull over boy and get your ticket right

Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands
The life you save could be your own
You're preachin' 'bout my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like for me there's no tomorrow

Go! Go! Go!

(speed demon)
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a leadway
(speed demon)
Got fire in my pocket
I just lit a rocket
(speed demon)
Just pull over boy and get your ticket right
(speed demon)
Pull over boy and get your ticket right
(speed demon)
Just, pull over boy and eat your ticket
Pull over boy
Pull over boy
And get your ticket right

Get your ticket right
Pull over boy
Get your ticket right
Pull over boy and get your ticket right
Pull over boy
Pull over boy and get your ticket eat your ticket get your ticket
Eat yo', get yo'
Get your ticket right
