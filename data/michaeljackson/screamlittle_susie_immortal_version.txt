[Michael Jackson:]
Tired of injustice
Tired of the schemes
Life is disgustin'
So what does it mean, damn it
Kicking me down
I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it

[Janet Jackson:]
Peek in the shadow
Come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong
Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Michael & Janet:]
With such confusions
Don't it make you wanna scream
(Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin'
Victimize within the scheme
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
Somebody please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw
As I turned on the TV this evening (Oh my God)
I was disgusted by all the injustice
All the injustice
(All the injustice)

Yeah yeah
Baby

With such collusions
Don't it make you wanna scream
(Make you wanna scream)
Your bash abusin'
(Make you wanna scream)
Victimize within the scheme
(You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize)
Oh brother, please have mercy
'Cause I just can't take it
Just can't take it
Just can't take it

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream
Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me
Make me wanna scream

Stop your pressure!
