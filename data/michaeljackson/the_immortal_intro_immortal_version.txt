Keep it in the closet
Who's bad?
Annie, are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Who's bad?

Dangerous
Another part of me
Who's bad?
Who's bad?

Who's bad?

(Abc excerpt)
(Rockin' robin' excerpt)

I'm goin' back to Indiana

(Part of the first hearing of Michael)

I think I love you

You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love

I'll be there [Chorus:] I'll be there
