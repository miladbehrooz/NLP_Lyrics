Will it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis

And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance

'Cause you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, e-e-e
All you need is the will to want it
And uh, little self-esteem

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You gotta know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground

So keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just
A matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

Believe in yourself
No matter what it's gon' take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith

...gon' keep it brother

And when you think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of
When you're all alone

And you can go by the feel
'Stead of circumstance
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance

I know that you can sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take
Will get you there
If you only try

So keep the faith, ow
Don't let nobody take you down,brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground

So keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

Lift up your head and show the world you got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith

Gon' keep it brother

Means never givin' up on love
But the power that love has makes it right
Makes it makes it right

To get your dreams up off the ground
