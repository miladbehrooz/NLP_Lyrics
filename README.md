# Natural language processing of web scraped lyrics

- Wrote a script with a **command line interface** for **web scraping of lyrics** of any artist from [AZLyrics website](https://www.azlyrics.com/) using **Beautiful Soup** and **regular expressions**

- Built a text **classification model** on *lyrics* with the goal to **predict an artist** from a piece of text

- Utilized **bag of words** (and vectorization) as well as **Naive Bayes** to implement a **classification model** for the described task

- Wrote another script with a command line interface for creating **fancy word cloud** from lyrics
